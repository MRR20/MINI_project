      "Royal Mail has launched a scanner tool in its app that lets customers check if a stamp is counterfeit. Following a row over £5 “fines” being levied on people who received a letter carrying an allegedly fake stamp, Royal Mail has also announced a new independent arbitrator to settle disputes about whether a stamp is genuine or not. Since the start of August last year, only new stamps with scannable barcodes have been valid for postage. In the months that followed, people who received letters were forced to pay a £5 penalty fee in cases where Royal Mail suspected that a counterfeit stamp had been used by the sender. Some customers whose letters were affected claimed that the stamps used were bought from Post Office branches, reputable retailers, or even Royal Mail’s own website. There have also been claims that realistic fake stamps mass-produced in China are being sold online and bought unwittingly by the public and smaller retailers. With the row gathering momentum, Royal Mail suspended the £5 penalty charges in April and said on Tuesday that it would “extend the pause” on the collection of the fee for those receiving letters carrying counterfeit stamps. It has also added a new scanner to its free-to-use app that will enable people to check if a stamp is a known fake, thereby preventing them from “inadvertently becoming victims of fraud”. Once the barcode on the stamp is scanned, the customer will be told whether or not it is counterfeit. If people did not buy their stamps from Royal Mail, a post office or another reputable outlet, they are being advised to scan them to make sure they are genuine. Meanwhile, the new independent arbitrator – an expert from the stamp dealer Stanley Gibbons – will make the final decision in cases where a surcharge is disputed by the customer and the complaint has reached deadlock. The expert will examine the stamp and his or her decision “will be fully independent of Royal Mail and the judgment binding”. The company said that since the introduction of barcoded stamps it had seen a 90% fall in use of fake stamps. It added that the “temporary” suspension of the surcharge would be kept under review. In the meantime, it will continue to slap stickers on letters if it believes the stamps used are counterfeit.\n",
      "For most of the past 15 years, Diageo was possibly the most admired company at the top end of the FTSE 100 index. As well as being an export titan for the UK, the Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness group performed beautifully for its shareholders year after year. Sales growth invariably beat inflation, underpinned by an enviable balance between developed and emerging markets. Profit margins steadily improved under a “premiumisation” strategy of encouraging punters to “drink better, not more”. Acquisitions worked, allowing Diageo to go from nowhere to leader in tequila in no time. Sir Ivan Menezes, who died just before he was due to retire as chief executive last summer, was rightly hailed as a boardroom superstar. And now? Well, it would be wrong to say Diageo’s woes are unique because the entire global spirits industry is having a weak run. But the company’s reputation for reliability and steadiness has disappeared faster than a shot of Don Julio. Debra Crew, the successor of Menezes, got off to a shocking start last November with a profits warning related to over-stocking in Latin America – in other words, a serious misreading of how much was actually being consumed by drinkers. Now, in Tuesday’s full-year numbers, came the first fall in annual sales since 2020. The shares, which were £40 as recently as 2022, lost another 5% to £24.18.   Related: Diageo hit by first post-Covid sales fall but Guinness soars in Great Britain   The latest headache is the US, Diageo’s largest market by far, where Crew complained about “cautious” consumers. Since companies from Nike to McDonald’s are saying the same, the factor is clearly genuine. Cuts in interest rates may help if they come, but in the old days one thought of Diageo as a company as an outperformer in all weathers. That element seems to have gone missing. Even the Mexican tequila operation took a whack from “down-trading”. In the circumstances, Crew’s insistence on sticking with a longstanding “medium-term” forecast for group-wide organic net sales growth of 5%-7% lacks credibility. Diageo has just turned in minus 0.6% and, even if one generously strips out Latin America, the figure was only 1.8%. In any case, what is “the medium term”? After the wild swings of the Covid period, which ended with a boom when pubs and bars reopened, Diageo may simply have become a less predictable operation. On the plus side, Crew reported that inventories in Latin America have normalised (though she’s yet to explain adequately how Diageo’s on-the-ground intelligence was so duff in the first place). The company says it held or maintained market share in 75% of its measured markets, including in the US. And cashflow arrived as previously advertised. For the time being, then, Crew should get the benefit of the doubt. There is little point in diluting the “premiumisation” strategy that worked well and may do so again; the spirts market has had downturns in the past. In the meantime, shareholders have the consolation of a Guinness operation (unfortunately only one-fifth of the whole) that keeps turning out excellent numbers. But Crew could still do herself a favour. The stock market has already mentally ditched the idea that Diageo is a steady 5%-7% sales performer, with only minor year-on-year variations within the range. Its business now looks more exposed to sudden swings. If you must have targets, give shareholders ones they can believe in. Until then, the unmistakable new air of suspicion around Diageo is justified.\n",
      "Rachel Reeves has accused Jeremy Hunt, her predecessor as chancellor, of lying about the state of the public finances inherited by the Labour government. Hunt has dismissed the claims as “absolute nonsense”. What is the row about? An audit conducted by the Treasury since Reeves’s arrival has identified £35bn of potential overspending by Whitehall departments in the 2024-25 financial year. The government does not expect to have to find all of the money and can use its reserves – a rainy day fund – to cover some of the costs. Even so, that would leave projected departmental spending £21.9bn above the totals set by the Treasury in Hunt’s March 2024 budget. Reeves has reduced that figure to £16.4bn by announcing £5.5bn of spending cuts, including the means testing of the winter fuel payments for pensioners. What does Reeves say? The chancellor said during the election campaign that she would inherit the biggest mess since the second world war but even so says she has been shocked at the state of the nation’s books. Reeves says the previous government made spending commitments but failed to allocate the money to fund them. She says Hunt covered up what was really happening: “He did that knowingly and deliberately. He lied, and they lied during the election campaign about the state of the public finances.”  What does Hunt say? Hunt says Reeves has confected a story about a £21.9bn “black hole” as a smokescreen for tax increases in the budget that she was always going to impose. As shadow chancellor, Reeves had privileged access to civil servants before the election, Hunt says, so she was up to speed with the state of the public finances. These were not in nearly as bad a state as Reeves claims, with £9.4bn of the additional spending pressure the result of a decision the chancellor herself has taken: to meet the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies in full. So who’s right? As tends to be the case, things are not entirely clearcut. Reeves cannot claim complete ignorance about the spending pressures and said herself during the campaign that the existence of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility meant it was not necessary to win an election to find out about the state of public finances. But the chancellor’s argument that things were even worse than she expected was bolstered when the OBR’s director, Richard Hughes, said on Monday that he was launching an inquiry into how the departmental spending totals for 2024-25 were prepared. The OBR became aware of the additional spending pressures only last week. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the numbers Reeves produced were new in that they had not been published before and that he found it astonishing that the £6bn bill for housing asylum seekers had not been budgeted for. Even so, it was always obvious Reeves faced tricky decisions, Johnson says. Isn’t this just a blame game? To a large extent, yes. Both Hunt and Reeves want to control the narrative, knowing that the impression left with voters now is likely to stick. Hunt’s message is that the economy and the public finances were on the mend under his stewardship, that extra money for the NHS was linked to productivity gains, and that his £10bn budget cut in national insurance was affordable. Reeves says unfunded promises were made of which the OBR was unaware and that already tough choices will now be even tougher as a result. How tough will those choices be? The Treasury may be able to shave a few billion pounds off departmental spending over the coming months, but whatever is left of the £16.4bn will have to be addressed in the budget on 30 October. Public spending totals for the next financial year look implausibly tight and there will be a recurring cost of this year’s public sector pay deals. Taxes are certainly going up. The only question is which ones.\n",
      "  4.41pm BST  Closing post  Time for a recap. Economic storm clouds are gathering over Germany again, after growth fell into reverse and inflation rose. German GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new economic data shows, putting Europe’s largest economy on the brink of recession. Analysts warned that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone, although Latvia (-1.1%), Sweden (-0.8%) and Hungary (-0.2%) all shrank by more. ABN Amro explains:  German Q1 GDP undershot expectations, contracting by 0.1% qoq (consensus and our forecast +0.1% qoq) after expanding by 0.2% qoq in Q1 The details will be published late August. For now, Destatis pointed to fixed investment, particularly in transport equipment and buildings as the main drag on GDP growth. Indeed, investment in Germany has been generally weak with the level of investment still lagging 2019 levels by about 4%; this is especially the case for investment in transport equipment such as cars. Furthermore, investment in buildings declined after being a source of strength in the Q1 GDP reading. This is not a surprise given the continued high level of interest rates, which have depressed demand and activity in the construction sector, particularly housing.  German inflation, on a harmonised basis, rose to 2.6% this month. The drop in Germany’s GDP took the shine of a solid, unspectacular, growth performance by the wider eurozone, which expanded by 0.3% in April-June. Spain was a bright light, growing by 0.8%, while France expanded by 0.3% – helped by the sale of a massive cruise ship to Royal Caribbean.

The number of job openings in the US has fallen slightly.     4.39pm BST  London market closes  After falling sharply this morning, London’s blue-chip stocks have clawed their way back, mostly. The FTSE 100 share index has ended the day down 18 points, or 0.2%, at 8274 points. Standard Chartered led the risers, after announcing its biggest ever share buyback this morning. But medical device maker Convatec was the top faller, down 5.8%, after missing profit expectations.

SW (Finance) I PLC (Southern Water) is currently rated at Baa3 – the lowest investment-grade rating. Moody’s has now placed its bonds on review for a possible downgrade. Moody’s says:  “The review for downgrade reflects our expectation that Ofwat’s draft determination would, if not materially changed... result in severe Outcome Delivery Incentive (ODI) penalties and total expenditure (totex) allowances below the level needed to fund Southern Water’s investment programme. “Together with an allowed return that falls significantly short of Southern Water’s actual cost of capital, such under-performance may challenge the company’s ability to raise equity finance to maintain leverage at levels consistent with the current rating.”  Southern Water is subject to enforcement monitoring by regulator Ofwat after a record £126m fine in 2019 over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England.

Pfizer grew its revenues by 2% year-on-year to $13.28bn, despite a drop in revenues from Covid products, as demand for its heart disease drug and its cancer therapy Padcev rise. David Denton, Pfizer’s chief financial officer and executive vice president, says:  “This was Pfizer’s first quarter of topline revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis, since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues peaked.  The company now expects annual profit to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share, up from a prior profit forecast of $2.15 to $2.35 per share. Pfizer also says it’s on track to cut costs by at least $4bn by the end of the year, through its “Cost Realignment Program”.     3.45pm BST  Microsoft investigating new service outage  Microsoft has said it is investigating reports of users having problems accessing its services, with some reporting being unable to access email and other functions, PA Media reports. An alert on the technology giant’s service status website said it is looking into a “network infrastructure” issue. According to website status platform DownDetector, users of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Xbox Live and players of popular video game Minecraft were among those reporting issues. The incident comes less than two weeks after a major IT outage knocked global infrastructure including transport and healthcare services offline because a flawed software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected Microsoft devices. On its service status website, Microsoft said:  “We are investigating reports of issues connecting to Microsoft services globally. “Customers may experience timeouts connecting to Azure services. We have multiple engineering teams engaged to diagnose and resolve the issue. More details will be provided as soon as possible.”      3.34pm BST   UK auditors BDO and Forvis Mazars have been urged to improve the quality of their audit work. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has today flagged the gap between the Big Four accountancy and BDO and Mazars. In its Annual Review of Audit Quality, the FRC says 74% of audits were categorised as good or requiring limited improvements. The big firms did well, with Deloitte at 94%, EY 76%, KPMG 89% and PwC 76%.

The Panel has concluded that ten parties should be “cold-shouldered”, a move which effectively bars them from any takeover-related activity, including buying or selling shares during a live takeover period. The Panel found that several executives of MWB Group Holdings had acquired shares in the company which, when added to the shares held by a pre-existing concert party, meant they controlled more than half its share capital – which would, if disclosed, force them to make a formal takeover bid. Omar Faruqui, Director General of the Panel, explains:  “Today’s ruling concludes the most complex investigation in the Panel’s 56-year history. Ten individuals have been cold-shouldered. They misled MWB Group shareholders and the market through a web of sham transactions and false trails stretching across many jurisdictions.  Exposing their deceit and wrong-doing is testament to the skill and determination of the Panel’s enforcement team.”  The ruling, which runs to over 100 pages, is online here. The Panel also decided that three members of management, including former MWB CEO Richard Balfour-Lynn, should pay compensation to shareholders, and has rejected an appeal from Balfour-Lynn. It has also publicly censured Andrew Blurton, a joint finance director of MWB at the time of some of the events in question. MWB entered administration in November 2012 and was liquidated on 15 April 2018.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining whether Alphabet’s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic has created a “merger situation”, and if so wheter it weakens competition. This is the latest in a series of moves by the CMA. Earlier this month it began a full investigation into Microsoft’s deal with AI startup Inflection, and in April it began seeking views on Amazon’s investment in Anthropic, which is a leading rival to OpenAI.

Cioffi explains:  Preliminary estimates reported a 0.3% quarter-on-quarter expansion of Eurozone GDP in the second quarter of 2024. Most major economies grew more strongly than we had been expecting, with the notable exception of Germany, which was worse off. Spain’s second quarter was well-rounded, with solid increases in domestic and foreign demand. France gained from both home and abroad, as well, though only to a minor extent with private consumption on the decline, while Italy was bolstered mostly on domestic demand. In Germany, the weak spot was fixed investments. The outlook for the Eurozone economy remains precarious for the rest of the year, with modest growth at best, as prices and interest rates remain high, and weak sentiment keep things cool, before picking up steam next year.      12.21pm BST  UK finance watchdog extends probe into car finance mis-selling  A major probe into whether people overpaid on their car loans has been extended by the UK’s financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority now expects to set out the next steps in its review into the past use of discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) in May 2025, having previously aimed to do this by the end of September. The FCA says:  We’re working hard to understand how DCAs affected the cost of credit for people borrowing money to buy a vehicle. We’re assessing thousands of records spanning 14 years.  The FCA’s investigation centres on the car loans market, and whether commission payments to brokers were too high. Those brokers were able to adjust the interest rates they charged customers, and some received “discretionary commission arrangements”, which meant they were paid more if the interest rate was higher.   Related: Car finance: what is the FCA looking into and will people get money back?   The FCA says today that firms involved in our review have engaged constructively with the regulator, but many have struggled to supply data within the requested time. Another wrinkle is that Barclays Partner Finance has begun judicial review proceedings of the Financial Ombudsman Service’s decision to uphold a complaint relating to its use of a DCA. Thousands of car loan customers who took out loans before 2021 have been complaining to lenders and brokers. The FCA says today it could bring in a redress scheme, so it is asking firms to pause complaint handling until 4 December 2025.

But, sterling could weaken on Thursday if the Bank of England decides to cut interest rates from their current 16-year high. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says:  “The Bank of England’s August policy announcement appears on a knife-edge, and one of the tougher rate decisions to predict for some time. We expect the MPC to deliver a 25 basis point cut on Thursday, albeit the vote on rates appears almost too close to call, and could be evenly split between the hawks and doves. On balance, we think that we’ve seen enough progress on inflation for those members that were close to voting for a cut in June to shift their allegiance in favour of the doves. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this view, particularly given the lack of communications from MPC members since the June meeting, in part due to the blackout period surrounding the general election.  Currently, the money markets indicate there’s a 59% chance of a rate cut on Thursday.  Ryan adds:  As this is not yet fully priced in, an immediate rate reduction would likely trigger some downside in the pound, albeit an upbeat set of communications, particularly a sizable upward revision to the GDP forecasts, could limit the extent of any sell-off.”    Related: Bank of England set to rain on hopes of interest rate cut after economic bounce       11.11am BST   In the UK, the Bank of England has created a new cost benefit analysis panel to provide advice when new rules are proposed for firms and financial market infrastructures.

This rate was above consensus expectations and matched the corresponding growth rate seen in Q1. The stronger-than-expected growth rate suggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line.

He tells clients this morning that the German economy will continue to hover between hope and despair:  With both the US and the Chinese economies losing momentum, along with new trade tensions, there is very little hope for a strong export-driven recovery. Also, weak industrial orders, high inventory levels and precautionary savings are still weighing on the economy. On top of that, the increasing number of insolvencies and individual company announcements of forthcoming job restructurings are still hanging like the Sword of Damocles over the labour market this year.  However, despite a weak start to the second half of the year, don’t rule out potential positive surprises. In fact, extremely weak May data could have been exaggerated due to many public holidays and long weekends. Plus, only a small improvement in industrial order books is needed to get industrial production growing again, admittedly from low levels. The highest increase in real wages in more than a decade should also loosen even German consumers’ traditionally very tight wallets eventually. All in all, today’s data once again confirms that Germany is the growth laggard of the eurozone. Caught between cyclical and structural headwinds, there is no easy way out of this long stagnation. Nevertheless, a rebound in the second half of the year is still possible, even though it is highly unlikely that it will be a strong one.

Germany’s GDP shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of this year, new data from statistics body Destatis shows.

And the boss of the London-headquartered but emerging markets-focused lender, Standard Chartered, is no exception. Bill Winters told journalists this morning that Labour appeared to be a “serious government” that was supportive of business and ready to tackle fiscal challenges that have dogged the UK economy. He said:  The new Labour Government is a serious government and they’ve set out a series of serious statements and platforms, including what the chancellor said yesterday in terms of addressing some of the fiscal challenges that we know are very present in the country. The rhetoric during the election period and in the early days of the government has been supportive of business. I think it’s been tempered by realism about the economic challenges and the fiscal challenges that the UK faces. But I have every confidence that the Chancellor and the rest of the government will pursue their policies in a very thoughtful, open and transparent way. And that’s as much as we could ask.   Winters added that he was “happy” to be headquartered in the UK, which he described as having a robust regulatory environment, a “very stable political environment” and “extraordinarily good rule of law” and corporate governance, adding:  “So there’s certainly nothing that has changed in terms of our views on the attractiveness of the Labour government”.

Pre-tax profits dropped to £5.46bn, from £5.64bn a year earlier. CEO Debra Crew told shareholders that the last financial year had been a challenging one for Diageo and the wider industry, due to “continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility”. Crew added:  Fiscal 24 was impacted by materially weaker performance in LAC [the Latin America and Caribbean region]. Excluding LAC, organic net sales grew 1.8%, driven by resilient growth in our Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe regions. This offset the decline in North America, which was attributable to a cautious consumer environment and the impact of lapping inventory replenishment in the prior year.  Great Britain was a highlights for Diageo, though – net sales here grew by 5%, thanks to stronger demand for Guinness – including the zero-alcohol Guinness 0.0 drink.

Related: Temperatures 1.5C above pre-industrial era average for 12 months, data shows   After BP reported an underlying profit of $2.76bn this morning, Alice Harrison, head of Fossil Fuel Campaigns at Global Witness, says:  “As the world faces record-breaking heat, most of us are desperate to see urgent action on the climate crisis. Unfortunately, it’s clear that BP couldn’t care less. While millions of us struggle with high temperatures and high bills, BP are raking in billions of profits, paying out massive dividends, and doubling down on dirty new oil and gas projects. Big oil companies like BP know their fossil fuel products are behind more deadly heatwaves, storms, and wildfires around the world, but instead of investing in clean energy, they are continuing to profit from people’s misery. Fossil fuel companies like BP are turning a blind eye to climate breakdown, so now governments must act. Rather than propping up the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry, we need them to make polluters pay for the damage they have already caused, and steer us towards a cleaner, greener future.”  Warm This Winter spokesperson Fiona Waters points out that BP has recently rowed back on some of its green energy plans:  “BP’s obscene profits today and the fact they have made £38.4bn since the start of the energy crisis shows they’re not interested in turning off their oil and gas cash cow. They have rolled-back on their green pledges that would mean lower bills, an end to energy price shocks and would also help save the planet.”    Related: BP imposes hiring freeze and halts new offshore wind projects   Chiara Liguori, Oxfam GB’s Senior Climate Justice Policy Advisor, says low-income countries desperately need help to handle the impact of the climate crisis:   “It is inexcusable that BP, one of the world’s most polluting and profitable fossil fuel companies, continues to rake in billions of pounds while low-income countries are in urgent need of funds to tackle the devastating impacts of the climate crisis despite doing the least to cause it. “The world can no longer afford fossil fuel companies putting short-term profits above people and planet. The costs of inaction are already here with deadly heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought but it is people living in poverty who are left paying the highest price.       7.50am BST   On this morning’s growth figures from France, economist Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that French food consumption fell in the last quarter, while consumption of gas and electricity, and cars, rose.

Jansen, who stood down as chief executive of BT in February after almost five years in the role, will join the board of the FTSE-listed WPP in September and formally take over as chair from January. “Philip brings a valuable blend of experience, from leading technology and consumer goods companies to transforming large, complex organisations and creating significant value for shareholders,” said Angela Ahrendts, senior independent director at WPP. Jansen, who began his career at Gillette to Ariel maker Procter and Gamble before moving into marketing director roles at Dunlop Slazenger and Telewest, led a BT turnaround strategy that included cutting 55,000 jobs by 2030 and investing £15bn in the nationwide roll out of full fibre broadband and 5G mobile networks. Earlier this month, Jansen, who took home a bumper £3.7m in pay and bonuses in his lat year at the telecoms company, was linked with a private equity backed takeover bid of British pest control firm Rentokil.   Related: Ex-BT boss pockets £3.7m final pay deal as group plans to axe 55,000 jobs   “Technology is changing the face of commerce, media and communications, and I am very excited to join a company at the forefront of this change,” said Jansen.     7.43am BST   Over the first half of this year, though, BP’s profits are lower than a year ago. The oil giant made $5.479bn in January-June, down from $7.552bn in the first six months of 2023. That follows a drop in Q1 – when earnings shrank to $2.7bn from $5bn a year ago (as we covered in May).     7.40am BST  BP raises dividend as second-quarter profit beats expectations  In the energy sector, BP has lifted its dividend after beating profit forecasts for the last quarter. BP has reported an underlying profit of $2.756bn for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.589bn in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.723bn it earned in Q1. That beat analyst expectations of $2.6bn. BP said the profit was due to “an average” performance in gas marketing and trading, lower refining margins, stronger fuels margins and “lower taxation”. It adds:  The underlying effective tax rate (ETR)* in the quarter was 33% which reflects the impact of the reassessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets.  BP is raising its dividend to eight cents per share, up from 7.27/share. The oil giant has also announced another share buyback, worth $1.75bn, for the last quarter, as it continues to use spare cash to buy back equity. Kate Thomson, BP’s chief financial officer, says:  We generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter, which helped reduce net debt to $22.6 billion. Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback programme commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation. We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for bp.      7.40am BST  Introduction: France gets Eurozone GDP Day off to a good start  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s eurozone GDP day, when we learn how the countries which share the single currency are faring economically. And the early news is that France’s economic growth was stronger than expected in the second quarter of this year. French GDP expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, new data from statistics body INSEE shows, beating expectations for 0.2% growth. That matches the 0.3% growth recorded across the eurozone’s second-largest economy in the first quarter of the year. It suggests France’s economy was stronger than expected this spring – before Emmanuel Macron stunned Europe by calling snap parliamentary elections last month.   Related: The Guardian view on Macron’s snap election: France on the brink | Editorial   INSEE reports that domestic demand “picked up slightly”, and added to growth. There was also a “slight rebound” in investment (or gross fixed capital formation). Household consumption was stable in the quarter, while foreign trade also made a positive contribution to growth. Exports grew by 0.6%, driven by a rise in transport equipment – which INSEE attributes to the “delivery of a new ship”.  \"delivery of a ship\" klaxon in the French GDP data ... had a lot of fun with that last time.— Claus Vistesen (@ClausVistesen) July 30, 2024  INSEE has previously predicted that the Olympic Games’ will lift France’s economic growth in the third quarter of this year Economists predict that the wider eurozone also grew in the last quarter, by an estimated 0.2%.

      "The fortunes of Australia’s economy – and political polling of the Albanese government – may well hinge on the strength of Wednesday’s inflation numbers. Economists expect headline consumer prices in the June quarter will land at an annual rate of 3.8%, accelerating from 3.6% in the prior three months. Core inflation – known as the trimmed mean – will be steady at 4%, a Bloomberg survey found.   Related: There’s a huge amount riding on the latest inflation figures. Here’s why   The Reserve Bank’s own forecasts in May of 3.8% for both headline and core inflation for the quarter just ended were both elevated from its predictions early this year. An upside surprise will likely heap pressure on the central bank to lift its cash rate to 4.6% – a 14th hike in this cycle – when its board meets next Monday and Tuesday.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the inflation data at 11.30 AEST. Should it meet expectations – or even fall shy – the calls instead will be for early interest rate cuts to ensure an economy already close to stalling doesn’t sink into recession. The RBA wants to be reassured inflation remains headed towards its preferred 2-3% range, a goal it currently expects will be achieved by the end of 2025.  Interactive  Households and businesses with debt are hoping it won’t take another RBA rate rise to ensure that trajectory is retained. Since the central bank began hoisting rates in May 2022, monthly mortgage repayments have increased about $240 per $100,000 borrowed, according to RateCity. Another quarter-point hike would add about $15 to the load and erode some of the government’s modified stage-three tax cuts delivering families about $240 a month. The investment bank UBS is in the minority, predicting the RBA will hike its cash rate to 4.6% next week. CPI has remained above the bank’s target band for 12 consecutive quarters and the past three months will make it 13, it noted. Governor Michele Bullock said in May the RBA board “has been clear that it has a low tolerance for allowing inflation to return to target more slowly than currently expected”, the bank noted. To do so “would risk eroding public credibility in our commitment to low and stable inflation”. Even accounting for some stickiness in inflation, Australia would be almost alone among rich nations in considering another rate rise. Only Japan, which in March lifted its key interest rate for the first time in 17 years as that nation’s deflation threat finally ebbed, is still considering raising borrowing costs. Canada and the European Union have started cutting rates and the US may follow in September. That downward shift may give the RBA’s nine-member board additional cause to stay put – as it has done since last November. Politicians have sought to frame the outcome knowing the possible boost – or hit – to the government’s standing may pivot on the ABS readings. An election this side of Christmas would be in prospect if the government viewed the RBA’s job was done. Another rate rise, though, would likely delay any election until next May, when the term ends, as any rate relief hopes dim. “Australians are in enormous pain because of Labor’s homegrown inflation crisis,” shadow treasurer Angus Taylor said, adding the country was the only one among the top 10 economies to have higher inflation compared with the end of 2023. “Australians face higher prices, higher interest rates and higher taxes for longer because of Labor’s bad economic management,” Taylor said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said inflation was “persistent” in the June quarter but the government remained confident it would resume its moderation from now. “We expect the big drivers on Wednesday to be things like insurance and rent and petrol, and of course petrol is impacted by the global oil price – and all this uncertainty we’re seeing in the Middle East,” Chalmers told ABC TV on Tuesday. “None of those factors are about government spending.” Research out this week from the ANZ senior economist Blair Chapman noted much of this year’s inflation pulse was driven by so-called administered or indexed prices, such as university fees. These were immune from higher interest rates in the near term.  “Non-administered and non-indexed inflation has declined notably and is running around levels consistent with the RBA’s target band on a six-month annualised basis,” Chapman said. In the March quarter, such items rose 3.3% year-on-year, down from a peak of 9%. In other words, an RBA rate rise “would likely slow activity in interest rate-sensitive sectors, slow employment growth and add to unemployment”. More reason to hold fire, then. Unless those CPI numbers light the fuse.\n",
      "Greggs has increased the amount it charges for some of its items, including an extra 5p on sausage rolls and their vegan equivalent, despite the bakery chain having said earlier this year it had no plans to increase prices. Roisin Currie, chief executive of the Newcastle-based group, said it had increased prices on a small number of products in recent weeks as it continued to come under pressure from a growing wage bill. She said Greggs had held off on other goods – such as breakfast and lunch meal deals – even though cost inflation remained at 4% to 5%. “The main driver of that is wages,” Currie said. “We put through a wage rise in January.”   Related: Diageo hit by first post-Covid sales fall but Guinness soars in Great Britain   Sausage rolls and the vegan variety have gone up 5p to £1.25, while a four pack has risen 10p to £3.75. Currie said Greggs had “no price increases on the cards currently” as it competes with other fast food chains, including McDonald’s, for a share of the breakfast and dinner markets. Greggs said in March that it had overtaken the US-owned burger chain to become the UK’s most popular breakfast spot. In the same update, Currie had said the chain had “no plans for further price rises” on top of December’s increases of between 5p and 10p on some items. McDonald’s said on Monday that its global sales had fallen for the first time in nearly four years in the second quarter as inflation-weary consumers skipped eating out or chose cheaper options. Currie said Greggs had benefited during the cost of living crunch as consumers sought out low-cost options for eating on the go. However, the price rises at Greggs reflect stubborn levels of inflation in the UK on food as some commodities continue to increase in price and wage rises add to costs. Shares in Greggs rose nearly 5% on Tuesday as the group reported a 16% rise in underlying first-half profits to £74m, 5% better than expected. Sales rose nearly 14% to £961m. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said he expected some “modest upgrades” in profit expectations, although Greggs said its hopes for the full year remained the same. Currie said sales growth had been driven by new store openings and relocations as well as new products, including pizza box deals and iced drinks such as its mango and strawberry cooler and the strawberries and cream refresher. She said the sporting summer, including the Euro 2024 men’s football tournament and the Olympics, had helped increase digital engagement and home delivery as fans bought snacks to accompany their home viewing. Delivery now makes up almost 7% of Greggs’s sales compared with 5.3% a year ago. The group opened a net 51 stores during the first half and it plans up to 160 during the next six months. Currie said most of these would be in locations such as railway stations, airports and retail parks, where there was an opportunity to open in the evening and further expand the group’s share of the dinner market. “The evening is growing faster than the average [store sales],” she said “We are very focused on it and believe that long term it will be a very profitable part of the business.” She said trading in the evening was not only important for walk-in sales but also for delivery.\n",
      "Valerie Labi, co-founder and chief executive of Wahu Mobility, enjoys a challenge. “If I see a problem and I think it can be solved, I follow that thread,” she says. The latest problem for Labi, whose company has produced Ghana’s first electric bicycle, is trying to persuade the country’s delivery riders to swap their ageing petrol motorcycles for herWahu ebikes. The idea for Wahu, which means “horse” in the Dagbani language of northern Ghana, came to her when she moved to the region’s capital, Tamale, in 2015, and heard neighbours complain about how expensive and unreliable transport was. Looking at ways to overcome this, Labi began buying secondhand push bikes during the pandemic in 2020 and turning them into ebikes by adding conversion kits bought from Amazon. Four years later, the company has now designed and developed its own licensed ebike and technology platform for delivery riders, opened an assembly plant in Ghana’s capital, Accra, and is about to close on an $8m investment round.   Lots of businesses are going to need last-mile mobility – do we really want them to be 14-year-old petrol vehicles?   There are now 300 delivery riders using Wahu ebikes in Accra, as the company looks to take advantage of Africa’s growing “last mile delivery” market – the final link in the supply chain to customers – a sector that is set to be worth $2.3bn by 2030. A further 2,000 users are expected to join within the next year. Labi has plans to eventually produce 50,000 Wahu ebikes a year and to introduce them across Africa, making huge carbon reductions in the process. “The average age of a vehicle in Ghana is 14 years,” she says. “We know there are going to be a lot of Amazon-type businesses needing last-mile mobility – do we really want them to be 14-year-old petrol vehicles?” The serene surroundings of the Landmark hotel in London’s Marylebone are a far cry from the hectic roads of central Accra. But Labi, who is in the UK as part of a trade mission to promote investment in Ghana’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sector, talks enthusiastically about how the Wahu model works. Riders buy the bikes under a payment plan of between 18 and 24 months, working out at up to $25 a week. Once on board, they are automatically put on Wahu’s fleet platform, which has partnerships with companies such as Bolt, so they have a consistent pipeline of work. Wahu ebikes are also cheap to run, costing just $13.60 a month to power, compared with $250 for a petrol vehicle. Alongside the physical ebikes, Wahu has also developed a technology platform. This not only tracks the bikes – no Wahu has been stolen yet – but measures carbon savings from journeys, which can then be packaged and turned into carbon credits.   Related: Pollution revolution: can electric motorbikes help clean up Benin’s air?   Its app also gives riders a safety score, with Wahu able to remotely shut down a bike if a user is deemed to be riding too dangerously. Some may see this level of monitoring and control as an overreach by the company, but Labi says the data is essential to making the product affordable. “It comes back to risk – things in our [Ghanaian] market are expensive because there’s no data,” she says. “Giving digital footprints opens people up to more affordable rates. That is why we can offer cheaper insurance – that is why we can offer them payment plans.” Labi was born and brought up in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, by Ghanaian parents who came to the UK for work in the 1970s. However, despite having lived for most of the past 15 years in Ghana, she didn’t visit the country until she was 14. “You only really got sent to Ghana if you were badly behaved,” she jokes. There was little chance of this happening to Labi. Head girl at Queenswood school in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, she then studied economics at Southampton University, where she began an internship at accounting firm EY and was subsequently hired. She initially envisioned a career in finance for herself, until the global crash of 2008. During this period, she saw colleagues who had invested huge amounts in shares in failed banks lose everything. It proved a defining moment for her. Disillusioned, she visited Ghana for Christmas in 2008 and didn’t return to the UK for another six years. Labi, who describes herself as a serial impact entrepreneur, has since headed several social enterprises across Ghana, enterprises that tackled some of the country’s biggest challenges. This includes a period at Global Mamas, an organisation that provided financial training and business support for more than 300 female-led SMEs in the country. She also founded Sama Sama, a Tamale-based sanitisation social enterprise providing low-income families the opportunity to buy toilets on an affordable payment plan. It operates across eight regions in Ghana and has served more than 100,000 people. Meanwhile, running Wahu Mobility, which she officially launched in 2022 alongside co-founder Toni Heigl, has not come without its own difficulties, which included being heavily pregnant during her initial talks with investors. Labi, who has three children, says that trying to raise funds while expecting was a challenge and made her question whether people would invest. However, she believes the Ghanaian culture is a lot more conducive to helping mothers succeed in business, with family and extended family often willing to look after children. “If you look at those leading Ghana’s banks, or those heading telecoms companies, many are women who have children,” she adds. Wahu is about to complete on the $8m it has targeted for its first round of funding, with the money to be channelled into delivering more of the bikes at its assembly plant, which opened in February. After a series of prototypes, the company has landed on a bike with front and back suspension so it can withstand Ghana’s potholes, as well as a thumb throttle to ensure quick acceleration at its busy junctions – something Labi says is essential in the country. It also includes two batteries with a combined range of 87 miles (140km) that can be recharged at home and do not require expensive charging infrastructure. Labi believes that this vehicle design, made with African conditions in mind, could set it apart from the cheaper ebikes being imported into the continent, and prove popular with delivery riders in other African countries. Wahu has already begun trialling ebikes in Lomé, the capital of neighbouring Togo, and is also targeting Zambia, Senegal, Morocco and Nigeria. It similarly has sights on becoming the first company to develop Ghana’s first four-wheel electric vehicle, with the business set to unveil its first four-wheeler for Africa in the coming months. But whether two-wheelers or four-wheelers, it is clear that Labi thinks the model works, and the benefits for Africa’s environment and economy could be huge too. Problem-solver Labi wants to be front and centre of the solution. “Our strategy is to become the sustainable fleet of Africa,” she says.

      "BP’s shareholders can expect a multibillion-dollar payout this year after the oil giant reported better than expected quarterly profits of almost $2.8bn (£2.2bn) and set out plans to develop a new oil hub in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil company has angered green groups by giving the go-ahead to develop potential oil resources of 10bn barrels from the new Kaskida project 250 miles south-west of New Orleans, after scaling back its green investments in the last quarter. At the same time it will raise its dividend payments by 10% while buying back stock worth $1.75bn over the next three months to bring its total buy-backs for the first half of the year to $3.5bn – and $7bn for 2024 as whole.   Related: Ofgem to encourage flexible use of cheap off-peak energy   In total BP has paid out $14.8bn to shareholders since June 2023, the month that marked the start of the world’s first year-long breach of the 1.5C heating limit, according to an analysis by Global Witness. Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuel campaigns at the campaign group, said: “While millions of us struggle with high temperatures and high bills, BP are raking in billions of profits, paying out massive dividends, and doubling down on dirty new oil and gas projects.” The shareholder windfall comes after BP reported better-than-expected profits of $2.76bn for the three months to the end of June, compared with analyst forecasts of $2.54bn for the quarter. The shares rose 2% in early trading on Tuesday. The company warned investors earlier this month to expect “significantly lower” profit margins from its refining business, which could wipe between $500m and $700m from its earnings for the quarter. It also told investors it would take a $2bn writedown resulting from a plan to scale back its refining operations at its Gelsenkirchen biofuels refinery in Germany by a third from next year in response to weaker demand. The chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, said BP was committed to delivering “a simpler, more focused and higher-value company” for shareholders. But the strategy has angered climate campaigner by appearing to scale back its green investments while pushing forward high-value fossil fuel projects. In addition to cutting investment in its German biofuels refinery the company has also ruled out further investment in offshore wind while driving forward plans for major oil projects. Auchincloss told the Guardian that BP is committed to transforming the company from an oil company to an “integrated energy company” and has set out plans to build between five and 10 green hydrogen projects this decade to help produce sustainable aviation fuel and decarbonise BP’s refining operations. He said BP was poised to go ahead with two green hydrogen projects, which produce the carbon-free gas through electrolysis using renewable power, at its Castellón refinery in Spain and at its Lingen plant in Germany. BP is also leading the world in biofuels, biogas and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Auchincloss said. “What the world needs now is construction – not more targets and pathways. That’s what we’re doing. We’re getting things done.” Although the oil company’s underlying replacement cost profit – the metric most closely observed by City analysts – reached $2.8bn for the second quarter, its reported result showed a £129m loss, compared with a reported profit of £1.8bn in the same quarter last year, because of the refinery writedown. Harrison said: “Fossil fuel companies like BP are turning a blind eye to climate breakdown, so now governments must act. Rather than propping up the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry, we need them to make polluters pay for the damage they have already caused, and steer us towards a cleaner, greener future.”\n",
      "Fears of a China trade war erupting under a second Trump presidential term are overblown, according to bosses at Standard Chartered bank, as they suggested that the country’s real estate woes were “largely in the rearview mirror”. While the London-headquartered bank makes most of its money in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, its chief executive, Bill Winters, played down the impact that increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing might have on the business. Winters told journalists on Tuesday that the administration of US president, Joe Biden, had already been “very hawkish on China”, implementing trade restrictions and sanctions that had not exactly thawed relations with one of the world’s largest economies. “Whoever wins this election, Harris or Trump, is likely to continue to be hawkish on China,” Winters said. Any pressure to open up China to the rest of the world will boost business for a cross-border lender like Standard Chartered, Winters added. “The more China is under pressure from international partners, the more they’re inclined to open up, in order to establish China as a very substantial trade and investment player globally,” Winters said. He added: “So I won’t say we’re not worried because tension in and of itself is bad for global sentiment and undermines business confidence to some degree. But this is not impacting our business and, you might say, quite the contrary.” The comments came as the bank reported pre-tax profits of $1.6bn (£1.25bn) in the second quarter, having beat the $1.5bn forecasted by analysts, thanks in part to growth across its wealth division that manages and invests money for rich clients. Official figures released earlier this month also showed that China’s economy grew 4.7% in the second quarter, falling short of expectations for a 5.1% rise. Standard Chartered warned that China’s growth rate was “unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels”, but Winters insisted policymakers were being very deliberate in their management of a maturing economy, including a recent real estate crisis that resulted in the forced liquidation of developer Evergrande. The bank’s chief financial officer, Diego De Giorgi, said it would be a “fool’s errand” to call a bottom on the China real estate market woes. However, he believed the financial ripple effects had largely been accounted for. “From our point of view, it’s a problem that is largely in the rearview mirror,” De Giorgi said. In February, the bank said it was expecting a maximum $1.2bn hit linked to its Chinese commercial real estate portfolio. “We have every confidence that China will maintain strong growth,” Winters added. “It’s still the the largest, or the second largest, contributor to global growth in any particular period, and we expect that will be the case in the quarters and years to come.”\n",
      "All Rex flights between capital cities have been grounded and the airline has entered voluntary administration just hours after the Albanese government suggested it would intervene to ensure the nation’s third-largest carrier didn’t collapse. Late on Tuesday, EY – formerly known as Ernst & Young – announced it had been appointed as administrators of the company, and that the airline’s Boeing 737 operations between capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been grounded, with Virgin Australia stepping in to offer impacted passengers rebooking “free of charge”. Rex’s regional operations with its Saab 340 turboprop planes remained unaffected by the administration and would continue to operate. The administrators said Rex and Virgin Australia were also exploring opportunities to support regional customers, including by having Virgin Australia sell Rex’s regional services through codeshare or interline arrangements, and making Velocity Frequent Flyer benefits available to Rex’s regional customers. Earlier on Tuesday, the federal transport minister, Catherine King, said her department had held “significant discussions” with Rex’s leadership after the airline on Monday requested a trading halt ahead of a significant announcement to the market. That announcement had been due by Wednesday morning. King, speaking from the site of the future western Sydney airport, said the government would wait for Rex’s announcement to the ASX which was understood to be in response to a report in the Australian newspaper that the airline had appointed consultants from Deloitte to advise how it could turn around its financial woes. “We’ll wait for Rex to make an announcement … but can I say very, very clearly, the government is in no doubt about the importance of regional aviation and Rex to regional aviation,” King said.   Related: Rex has stopped taking bookings amid reports the airline is about to appoint administrators   “We will work with Rex, we want to make sure that they have a future as part of aviation in this country, and we’re very determined to make sure that happens. We obviously don’t want to do that at any cost, we want to be involved very closely in what that future might look like.” Rural mayors across Australia whose communities rely on Rex for connectivity warned of further isolation if the carrier went under, while leaders of larger regional centres feared airfare price hikes from Qantas if the routes were left without competition. “They’re crucial – this is our highway,” the Devonport mayor, Alison Jarman, said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The airline’s board – which has been rocked by tensions in recent months – was scheduled to meet on Tuesday evening, amid a report from 10 News that airline staff had been locked out of hotels and company Uber accounts. Rex on Tuesday afternoon was not taking bookings for its jet services between capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Regional services could still be booked at that time. The airline on Monday requested a trading halt following the weekend news story it had engaged Deloitte. Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday that Rex was set to appoint EY as administrators.  Bridget McKenzie, the opposition transport spokesperson, was cautious about the government’s intention to help Rex, noting revelations in Guardian Australia on Tuesday that King had known about Bonza’s financial instability 10 days before it entered administration but turned down the budget carrier’s plea for financial help. McKenzie blamed the government for failing to help smaller airlines compete with Qantas, which Rex had recently tried to do with flights between capital cities. “As soon as Rex made the announcement they were going to tackle the big boys, take them on on that golden triangle and those capital city routes, Qantas all of a sudden took retribution on marginal regional routes. [Qantas] lost money, a bit like $1 milk for supermarkets … to actually damage Rex’s financial position,” McKenzie told ABC TV. The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the prime minister “should consider just buying Rex”. “Transport is an essential service, so why not protect people who rely on regional services by bringing this critical airline into public hands?” Bandt said. On Monday, the Australian stock exchange announced it had suspended trade in Rex’s shares at the airline’s request “pending it releasing an announcement”. Rex said the trading halt came ahead of an announcement “in relation to a news article published on Saturday”. The competition watchdog’s most recent domestic airline monitoring report stated Rex had a 5% market share in March. At the same time, now-collapsed budget carrier Bonza held 2%. Rex recorded the lowest cancellation rate in March at 0.8% compared with Qantas at 3.8%. Rex in February reported a loss of $3.2m for the first half of the 2023-24 financial year, compared with a $16.5m loss in the previous six months. It said escalating costs, particularly for fuel, made it hard to predict full-year profitability. Rex was initially called Regional Express following its formation after the death of Ansett. Rex has mostly been a regional carrier, operating 36-seater Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. However, in 2020, Rex began vying for a share of the lucrative market between capital cities, seizing on the instability in Australia’s domestic aviation market which occurred when Virgin Australia entered administration and underwent a significant restructuring. Rex leased Boeing 737 jets, including several formerly flown by Virgin, and launched routes between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. However, it has struggled with numerous issues, including allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by Qantas, and difficulty accessing strategically important Sydney airport slots at peak times – a gripe echoed by Bonza. Rex has also confronted a shortage of parts to repair its ageing fleet of Saab 340 aircraft for its core regional operations, which have also been hampered by a shortage of pilots for the smaller planes. Rex shares have halved in value over the past 12 months and were trading at 56.5 cents before being suspended this week. Sources say the drop concerned PAG Asia Capital, the private equity firm that funded Rex’s expansion into capital city routes to the tune of $150m. Rex has also been rocked by leadership tensions, with major shareholder and former executive chair Lim Kim Hai ousted in June. Lim was replaced by John Sharp who had been deputy chair of the board. Sharp, a former Nationals federal transport minister, has in recent years made headlines with his criticism of Qantas and aviation policy. Lim has since pushed to remove Sharp and three other directors from the board, with a special shareholder meeting due to vote on Lim’s demands. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday he would consider proposals to save the company but added Rex already received substantial public funding with “no conditions attached”. “One of the things I expressed concern about was having no conditions so Rex, for example, moved away from their traditional role of being a regional airline into flights, for example, from Sydney to Melbourne,” Albanese said. - Additional reporting by Daisy Dumas\n",
      "The delivery of the world’s second-largest cruise ship lifted France’s economy in the second quarter, according to official data that also showed Germany heading into a recession. Built in Saint-Nazaire for the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean, the Utopia of the Seas added €1bn (£840m) to French economic output, helping to increase trade growth to 0.6% in the three months to the end of June and gross domestic product to 0.3%. The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the third quarter after a revised rate of 0.3% in the first, prompting many analysts to say that the 20-member euro bloc has turned a corner after flirting with recession in 2023.   Related: Germany on brink of recession after GDP shrinks; eurozone beats forecasts with 0.3% growth – business live   Spain powered ahead with a 0.8% growth rate in the second quarter, while Italy’s recovery was maintained by a 0.2% rise in GDP. Germany, the largest eurozone economy, slid back into contraction, recording a 0.1% fall in output. Pushpin Singh, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said the eurozone growth rate was better than expected by City analysts and “suggests the bloc has turned a corner since the start of the year”. He added: “Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by recent policy loosening by the European Central Bank and expectations for further interest rate cuts down the line.” Bert Colijn, a senior economist at the Dutch bank ING, was more concerned that German growth would become a significant drag on the eurozone. “Germany remains the weak link in this post-pandemic economy but the rest is not fantastic either. “Leave out Spain and you just have an economy that moves along at a lacklustre growth pace.”  France’s economy grew marginally faster than expected and could improve again in the third quarter if the Olympics spur consumer spending, dispelling concerns that deadlock in the French parliament after recent elections would knock the economy off course. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the economy’s performance in the second quarter and the Paris Games meant growth this year would probably exceed the outgoing government’s 1% forecast. “We will probably have growth after all that is better than the 1% forecast in February,” Le Maire said. “For two years, France has outperformed; our economic policies work and are giving tangible results.” He added that the better than expected growth could be positive for the strained budget deficit and France needed to stay focused on reducing spending. Anja Sabine Heimann, an economist at HSBC Germany, said industrial orders were weak and German consumers were reluctant to spend, adding that the risks of a recession were “elevated”. The country has suffered almost zero growth over the past two years and avoided a recession only by a whisker. Heimann said many of the ingredients of a slowdown were now in place. “Domestic and foreign industrial orders continue to trend downwards – highlighting little support from industry in the near-term,” she added. “With consumer prices nearly one-fifth above 2019 levels, even after recent strong nominal wage growth, German households have not yet recouped their spending power. “Consequently, their spending scope is still somewhat constrained and there is unlikely going to be a large consumer spending spree.”\n",
      "Chinese carmakers secured a record 11% of the European electric vehicle market in June, as buyers raced to beat EU tariffs on imported EVs that came into force this month. The figures, which include the UK, show that about 23,000 battery electric vehicles were registered in June, up 72% on the previous month as consumers raced to beat the price hike in the EU. According to data analysis by Dataforce, the Chinese state-owned SAIC, parent of the British brand MG, was responsible for the biggest jump but 40% of the imports were registered by dealers rather than drivers themselves, another sign of a pre-tariff sales rush.   Related: ‘High quality, low price and dizzying variety’: how the Chinese switched to electric cars   The electric carmaker sold just under 13,400 cars in June compared with sales of just under 4,000 at rival BYD, which sells the Dolphin and Seal brands. SAIC is subject to the highest EU tariff of 38% compared with BYD cars, which have had a 17% levy imposed since 5 July as part of the EU’s bid to create a level playing field with its own carmakers including BMW, Audi and Stellantis’s Fiat and Renault. Incentives to buy electric cars turbo-boosted sales in Italy, where about €200m (£168m) in subsidies on new EVs ran out within nine hours of their launch, said Dataforce. It comes as fresh customs data from Beijing shows the EU and UK took nearly half all China’s exports of electric cars in the first six months of the year by value. Data analysed by the Chinese trade specialist website Soapbox showed the UK took 12%, while the EU took 36%, compared with just 1% in the US, which slapped 100% tariffs on imports earlier this year. Brazil and Australia were the third equal most important markets at 7% each of all sales, followed by Thailand, UAE and South Korea at 4% each and Israel at 3%. Research by the Spanish bank BBVA showed that the cost of a Chinese car in Europe is generally twice that of its price tag in the domestic market. BYD’s entry level Dolphin car sells at just over £30,000, almost three times its price in China £10,900. By contrast the Polestar 3 selling at £53,000 in the UK just 64% higher than its list price in China. The biggest markets for Chinese EVs in Europe are Germany, the UK and France, followed by Norway, Belgium and Italy. Of the 208,872 EVs sold in Europe in June, just more than 43,400 were sold in Germany, down 18% month on month. In the UK, sales increased 7.4% to 34,000, while in France they dropped 10% to just under 30,000. Earlier this year, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) car industry trade body showed a massive jump in Chinese electric battery car sales in Europe, a category that strips out plug-ins or hybrid cars. In 2023 Chinese-made electric battery cars, including Tesla and EU brands made in China, accounted for 21.7% of all sales, up from 2.9% in 2020. Chinese brands accounted for 8% of that market share, ACEA data showed.\n",
      "Global sales at the drinks multinational Diageo have declined for the first time since the Covid pandemic, although Great Britain bucked the trend thanks to a rise in the popularity of Guinness and related drinks. Sales increased 5% in Great Britain, a rise credited to the rise in popularity of the Irish stout and spin-offs such as an alcohol-free version and its Nitrosurge home-pouring technology. Diageo said overall sales of its beer brands grew 18% globally over its last fiscal year, primarily driven by Guinness. Great Britain and Ireland provided the biggest boost to the leading brand, and sales of the non-alcoholic Guinness 0.0 more than doubled year on year globally.   Related: Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin nets nearly £10m from share sale   However, sales of spirits declined 1% across Diageo’s European markets. Strong growth in raki and Baileys was more than offset by the falling popularity of its scotch, gin and rum portfolio. Shares fell 9% to a four-year low at one point on Tuesday after the sales figures were released. The company said that over the last financial year it had increased its spend on marketing by 4%, with a focus on tequila, beer and its Johnnie Walker brand. Diageo said sales across Europe grew 3% at an organic level, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Turkey and mid-single-digit growth in Great Britain and Ireland. “Diageo Europe delivered a strong performance with market share growth across most European markets despite persistent cost inflation and lower consumer confidence,” the company said. However, total net sales fell 1.4% to $20.3bn and annual operating profit was down 4.8% to $304m, of which the company blamed $302m on the Latin American and Caribbean region. Last autumn Diageo said economic pressures in the region had pushed consumers to drink less and switch to cheaper options. The Diageo chief executive, Debra Crew, said the company had taken steps to resolve its problems in the region and improve its performance elsewhere. “We are confident that when the consumer environment improves, the actions we are taking will return us to growth,” she said. In North America sales declined 2% as consumers cut back on drinking tequila, sales of which fell by 5%. The company’s Casamigos brand experienced a 22% fall in sales but its stablemate Don Julio grew by 22%. Sales of vodka fell 8% by in North America. Crew said it was “hard to call” when Diageo would be able to meet its medium-term sales target, adding that this was affected by factors such as high inflation and consumer confidence.\n",
      "If you’ve ever awkwardly scrambled to find a pen to fill in the incoming passenger card on a flight into Australia, you’re not alone. A report from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry called for the paper cards to be abolished, one of several recommendations aimed at modernising Australian air and seaports’ passenger processing. The paper cards, a staple of air travel to Australia, were dubbed “antiquated” by the chamber, who warned their use risked Australia’s reputation as a desirable destination for tourists. The card asks passengers to declare food, plant material and animal products, as well as to provide personal details like your address in Australia, passport number and an emergency contact.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The report also called for multiple-entry visas available for key markets such as India and China, replacing the SmartGate system with “passenger on the move” technology and to ensure an appropriate amount of air traffic in and out of Australian airports in a bid to keep prices competitive. The Australian Chamber – Tourism executive chair, John Hart, said modernising the inbound and outbound passenger experience could mean huge revenue for the tourism industry.   Related: Storms, fires and floods: Blue Mountains Jenolan Caves to close after series of unforgiving weather events   “We estimate the changes would bring in an additional $50bn a year with appropriate targeting and with the appropriate reputation. We have done the analysis and we believe the gap is that wide.” Hart said the incoming passenger cards were a “huge sticking point in terms of reputation”. “Most aircrafts don’t have a supply of 400 pens to be handing around to people as they arrive. Just seeing those visions of people handing around a biro, standing around baggage claim filling them out, it’s absurd.” “Especially when 90% of the information on the form has already been given to three or four people in the supply chain, like airlines or hotels.” He said it was about eliminating the “annoying” parts of the inbound and outbound passenger process, in a bid to attract more return visitations.  “We are at the end of the Earth, so we need to be attracting high-value travellers that make the journey worthwhile.” According to the World Economic Forum, Australia ranks 53rd for ground and port infrastructure and 112th for price competitiveness out of 119 countries. The report said it was “imperative” that barriers preventing international visitors from travelling to Australia were reduced or, where possible, removed. “Many of these barriers exist in the form of expensive and complex visas. This part of the traveller journey – towards the beginning of any inbound traveller’s journey – could easily be the reason a prospective traveller reconsiders Australia as a destination,” the report read. “There is a clear need to adopt emerging technology in better facilitating travellers in and out of Australia.” “Whether this be through check-in services or collecting required data through immigration, Australia is being left behind in its resistance to embrace this technology.”\n",
      "UK consumers have cut back on summer spending amid the impact of poor weather and the cost of living crisis, figures show, underscoring the challenge for the Bank of England ahead of its interest rate decision on Thursday. In a sign of weakness in consumer spending over the summer months, figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that clothing and footwear prices fell for the seventh consecutive month in July as weak demand persisted. Separate figures from the Bank of England show that credit-card borrowing also slumped in June as poor weather for the time of year and concerns about the cost of living deterred households from spending. The figures came as financial markets predict the Bank’s interest rate decision on Thursday will be on a knife edge as policymakers consider whether to cut borrowing costs for the first time since the Covid pandemic.   Related: Bank of England set to rain on hopes of interest rate cut after economic bounce   After a drop in headline inflation to the government’s 2% target for two consecutive months, City economists believe Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee could narrowly vote to cut interest rates from the current level of 5.25%. The Bank has said its decision will rest on whether price growth in the service sector of the economy is slowing, and whether Britain’s jobs market is cooling to levels consistent with keeping inflation near 2%. Reflecting subdued consumer appetite as households held back from spending, the BRC figures show annual shop price inflation was unchanged in July at 0.2%. This was below the three-month average rate of 0.3%, and the lowest rate since October 2021. Non-food price deflation, which means prices are falling compared with a year ago, continued at 0.9%, marginal slower than 1% in June, as retailers cut their prices in an attempt to lure reluctant consumers. The BRC’s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: “Holidaymakers could pick up bargain summer wear and summer reads as clothing and footwear prices fell for the seventh consecutive month amidst persistent weak demand, and the prices of books fell.” The Bank’s figures show that net consumer credit borrowing fell from £1.5bn in May to to £1.2bn in June, missing City economists’ forecasts for a stronger growth rate as households held back from borrowing to finance their spending. The global and UK head of financial services at the accountancy firm KPMG, Karim Haji, said the figures showed that customers were yet to feel the effects of recent stronger levels of economic growth and lower inflation. “What is clear is that despite two straight months of inflation remaining on target, households aren’t necessarily feeling better off for it,” he said. ”Indeed, wage growth has slowed in recent months, which may go some way to explaining this.” Retailers, however, are hopeful that a pickup in spending could come given a rise in footfall at UK shopping destinations after the start of the school summer holidays last week. The data provider MRI Software said footfall rose by 4.8% in all retail destinations compared with the previous week, led by a 6.9% jump in shopping centre activity, a 4.4% rise in visits to high streets and a 3.3% increase at retail parks. The Bank’s latest snapshot also shows that net mortgage approvals, which indicate future levels of borrowing, remained largely unchanged in June from a month earlier, in a sign of the property market treading water before the general election and Thursday’s rate decision. RBC Capital Markets’ European housebuilding analyst, Anthony Codling, said: “Stability is good, but in our view, the UK housing market appears to be treading water, waiting for, hoping for the first Bank Rate cut. There is a small chance that cut could come on Thursday, but we believe the first cut is more likely in September. Once mortgage rates start to fall, we expect housing market activity to pick up.”\n",
      "For George Osborne read Rachel Reeves. For 2010 read 2024. The party affiliation might be different but the message from the two chancellors shortly after arriving at the Treasury was the same. In both cases it amounted to two basic propositions: this is going to hurt, and the other lot are to blame. Like Osborne, Reeves said she would not duck tough decisions, and she was as good as her word. Labour’s first chancellor in 14 years announced £5.5bn of spending cuts and made no secret of the fact there would be more pain to come in the budget on 30 October. Even after the decisions to scrap infrastructure projects, can the Rwanda asylum seeker scheme, means-test the winter fuel payment for pensioners and abandon plans to make social care more generous, Reeves said she would still have a £16.4bn hole to fill. The implications of that are clear. There are tax rises to come in the budget and tight settlements for Whitehall departments in a one-year spending settlement. Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said she expected tax rises of £10bn, with the rest of the shortfall covered by £7bn of additional borrowing. All of which is par for the course for an incoming chancellor. A well-established rule of politics is to get bad news out of the way early and craft a narrative that the measures are unavoidable due to the incompetence of the previous lot. Osborne proved a master of that in 2010 with his repeated refrain that Gordon Brown’s Labour government had failed to mend the roof while the sun was shining. Labour has learned from the experience. In truth, some of the “hole” in the public finances was due to Reeves’s decision to accept the recommendations of pay review bodies for public sector workers. That will cost £9.4bn and as Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted, was not quite the bombshell the chancellor professed it to be. Johnson did, however, provide some useful political cover for the chancellor. She was within her rights to feel aggrieved at some of the upward pressures on spending that she had only found out about since arriving at the Treasury. “Some of the specifics are indeed shocking, and raise some difficult questions for the last government,” Johnson said. “If the scale of these overspends and spending pressures was apparent in the spring – and in lots of cases, there’s no reason to suppose otherwise – then it is hard to understand why they weren’t made clear or dealt with in the spring budget. Jeremy Hunt’s £10bn cut to national insurance looks ever less defensible.” Sooner or latter, no matter how successful Reeves is at playing the blame game, governments are judged by their own choices. Her decision to cut infrastructure spending sits oddly with Labour’s “growth mission”, while the decision to limit winter fuel payments to households receiving pensioner credit will not be universally popular in Labour circles either. Honeymoons don’t last for ever.\n",
      "No, the long and painful saga of HS2 did not reach its final destination when Rishi Sunak axed the entire northern phase of the project last October. For starters, there is the mopping-up exercise on the cost of that decision – a write-off of £2.17bn in the latest accounts. Of that, £1.1bn is money actually spent on the ground in preparing phase two before it was jettisoned. It is money down the drain in the purest sense. But then there is the unresolved question of Euston, which has been its own fiasco within the greater shambles. The intended HS2 station on the site has been through two designs already and there is still nothing resembling a final plan, in large part because the Department for Transport “still does not know what it is trying to achieve”, as the public accounts committee put it in July last year. The former prime minister’s last contribution was to ditch the 10-platform version and appoint a new development body to attract private capital and develop a definitive strategy. On the plus side, Sunak’s action did at least seem to acknowledge that it would be absurd to stop the railway at Old Oak Common, five miles to the west of Euston. All the modelling shows the destination would primarily be convenient only to about a third of passengers – those going on to Heathrow or catching the tube network’s Elizabeth line.  On the downside, the outgoing government did not actually provide the funding to set the tunnelling machines in motion to complete the last leg to Euston.   Related: HS2 reveals £2bn in costs linked to Sunak’s downgrade of line   It is why the forward-looking detail on page 48 of HS2’s annual report, as opposed to the historical write-offs, was the critical bit of the document: “Failure to secure funding to deliver Euston tunnels and station could impact the organisation’s ability to safely operate and maintain Old Oak Common Station and train services across HS2, Great Western Main Line and Elizabeth line.” Well, quite. Stopping at Old Oak Common would probably overwhelm the already heavily-used Elizabeth line and make the whole system less resilient.  Many west coast passengers would probably continue to use the conventional service to Euston, thereby undermining the supposedly core idea that HS2 will release capacity for local services.  In short, there is no alternative to going onto Euston. HS2, even in its slimmed-down incarnation, makes little sense without it. Despite speculation that the future of the Euston tunnel hangs in the balance, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, did not mention it in her list of spending cuts on Monday.  Let us hope that means the money will arrive from somewhere because a critical point is fast approaching. The boring machines, awaiting final assembly in Germany, need to be dropped into place at Old Oak Common before the next stage of work on the station, due to be completed between 2029 and 2033, proceeds.  The actual design of Euston can wait a while, but a green light for tunnelling is required within months. The overspend on the misconceived HS2 over the years has been a national embarrassment. But phase one without the leg to Euston would make a bad situation worse. Reeves should clear up the fresh uncertainty over the tunnel. It has to be built.\n",
      "Reckitt Benckiser’s share price has dropped to a 10-year low after a US court ruled that a formula produced by rival Abbott Laboratories had caused a baby girl to develop a serious bowel disease. Shares in the British consumer goods group, which is facing similar legal action over its Enfamil formula, saw its shares plunge by about 9% to roughly £40.75 a share on Monday after Abbott was ordered to pay $495m (£385m) in damages by a court in Missouri on Friday. A St Louis jury concluded that Abbott’s specialised formula for premature babies had led to an Illinois baby developing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a dangerous bowel condition. Abbott intends to appeal. The judgment is the latest lawsuit against Abbott and Reckitt over alleged health effects caused by their formulas for premature babies.   Related: Reckitt Benckiser: how one terrible deal wrecked the company   In March, Reckitt, whose other major brands include Durex and Nurofen, was ordered to pay $60m in damages to a mother who claimed that Enfamil, produced by Reckitt company Mead Johnson, had led to the death of her baby. Reckitt faces its own NEC-related trial in September and investors are waiting to see whether the company will be subject to further payouts. Analysts Jefferies said the Abbott ruling was likely to “depress sentiment” for Abbott and Reckitt, and has already estimated a discount for the legal liability of £3bn for Reckitt. It said: “With [Reckitt’s] own new individual trial due to start on 30 September and multidistrict litigation action gaining momentum, that risk may be extended this week we think.” According to Reuters, there are now 1,000 cases that have been filed against each, or both, of the companies in US federal or state courts.  The lawsuits claim the companies did not warn doctors that infants receiving formula had a greater risk of a deadly disease than infants who are breastfed or given donor milk or human milk-derived formula. Abbott and Reckitt have denied the claims and say there is no evidence their products cause NEC. Responding to Friday’s judgment, an Abbott spokesperson said: “Verdicts like these, where the science and opinions of healthcare professionals who spend their lives treating these babies are ignored, make it difficult to continue supplying these products indefinitely.” Analysts from JP Morgan said the $495m damages figure was much higher than expected, with analysts expecting a payout of between a $60m and $100m.  The brokerage said: “With a final settlement likely a way away, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the verdict weigh on sentiment until there’s a clearer path forward for resolution of the matter.” Abbott’s stock was down 6.9% at $98.32 before the closure of markets on Monday, while Reckitt’s £40.75 share price on Monday was its lowest since January 2013. Reckitt said: “We stand behind the safety and efficacy of our preterm nutrition products, which neonatologists recommend when clinically appropriate as a part of the standard of care in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). “Claims by plaintiffs’ lawyers that these products cause NEC are not supported by the science or the medical consensus and are irresponsible.”\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s a common myth that ‘no-one pays capital gains tax’. It is true that most of this tax is paid by a relatively small number of people, but the rapid increase in the amount of CGT paid, the cuts to the annual tax-free allowance, and the numbers paying this tax show it’s something all investors need to consider.\n",

      "Name: Airline safety videos. Age: Around since the 1980s. Appearance: Increasingly elaborate. Oh God, this might be the most boring Pass Notes yet. Honestly, who watches airline safety videos? Loads of people. You have no idea. Half a million people have watched the new British Airways one. Well, yeah, because they’re all trapped on a plane with nothing else to do. Sorry, I should clarify. Half a million people have watched the new British Airways one on YouTube. Hang on, they’re watching an in-flight safety video at home? Of their own accord? That’s right, yes. Why? Because it’s quite good. The five and a half minute video, entitled May We Haveth One’s Attention, sees a number of figures inspired by classic British literature being interrupted by BA staff. It was directed by Sharon Maguire, who made Bridget Jones’s Diary, with costumes by the Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan.    And it’s going down well? Apparently so. One of the many positive comments it has received on YouTube reads: “This is the single most impressive safety video I have ever seen.” Wow, what a gamechanger. Well, not really. Last year’s safety video had Ncuti Gatwa and Robert Peston in it, and a commenter described it as: “Best safety video ever by an airline or should I say ‘brilliant!’” People on YouTube really are easily pleased. It just goes to show the effort that airlines have to make to get people to watch their safety briefings. It’s so easy to tune out during them – they need to grab and hold your attention. When did this start? The first video of this kind is thought to be Delta’s film from 2008, in which a flight attendant wags her finger with admirable sass when telling people not to smoke onboard. Whoa, the excitement. Things escalated quickly, though. Ten years ago, Air New Zealand did a Hobbit-themed video with wigs and costumes, bungee jumps and Taika Waititi dressed as a wizard. I just watched it! It was amazing! And now you can remember exactly what to do if your plane runs into trouble, right? Uhhhh … Right? Sorry, the video was so much fun that I stopped concentrating on the safety instructions. This is the downside of the videos. They require a careful balance between fun and education, and it’s easy to tip too far into the former. So what’s to be done? Have you tried ignoring the video and just watching the flight attendant’s demonstration instead? All the same information, plus you get to prove to a stranger that you’re better than all the other passengers because you actually pay attention. Do say: “Safety videos need to work hard to make people watch them.” Don’t say: “Because the threat of death apparently isn’t enough.”\n",
      "Ofgem is pushing ahead with plans to make it easier for British homeowners to reap the benefits of using electric car chargers and heat pumps at non-peak times, as the grid becomes more reliant on wind and solar power. The energy regulator for Great Britain has put forward proposals to encourage flexible electricity use in the home by creating a single register in which flexibility service providers (FSPs) can access more markets and better rates for owners of energy assets such as EV chargers and battery storage systems. The move is part of a drive to shift consumers and businesses to more flexible energy use as demand increases and the grid becomes more reliant on intermittent low-carbon energy sources such as wind turbines.   Related: Labour must speed up wind power expansion or miss targets, says renewables industry   Under the current system, FSPs, which aggregate flexible energy assets on behalf of customers, must sign up several times to access different local and national flexibility markets across the country, meaning customers often miss out on the best rates. The new streamlined system will include a “one-stop sign-up point” that would give FSPs access to all flexibility markets, which it turn would mean customers have more chance of benefitting from lower tariffs at times when demand is low or supply is high. Ofgem said the current complicated system was a barrier to market access for millions of small-scale energy assets, and prevented consumers from obtaining maximum value from their equipment. The need to use electricity more flexibly comes as domestic energy use is predicted to increase by 50% by 2035 as the take-up of EVs and heat pumps increases, while more energy production will come from more intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar as the UK tries to achieve net zero emissions targets. The regulator said its shake-up should drive more flexible energy use and could contribute to between £30bn to £70bn in savings and lower bills for all consumers by reducing the need to build as much expensive infrastructure. A number of energy providers and distribution networks have already begun providing flexible services to homeowners to avoid overloading the grid at peak times. They include Octopus Energy, whose Go electric tariff manages the charging of 150,000 electric cars and provides lower tariffs for owners to charge in the quiet hours of the night. National Grid has also run a series of demand flexibility days since January during which households and businesses were paid to cut back on their electricity use during the peak period, usually between 4pm and 7pm. Ofgem’s director, Eleanor Warburton, said: “We are already starting to see real acceleration in small-scale flexible energy use as consumers increasingly access cheaper energy through more flexible consumption … Asset registration will create a streamlined one-stop sign-up point, which will help maximise consumer participation.” The regulator also announced on Monday that it had appointed Elexon as its new market facilitator to develop local flexibility markets. The facilitator, which is expected to be fully operational by early 2026, will act as an independent expert to help drive alignment between national and local distribution networks.\n",
      "As the Conservative party hurtled towards electoral defeat, Philip Davies MP appeared to be weighing up his next career move already. On 20 June, the veteran backbencher incorporated a new company, Nessen Ltd, describing the nature of its business as “management consultancy” in a filing to Companies House. The candidate and former honourable member for Shipley listed his own occupation as “consultant”. Days later, Davies would insist he was still “busting a gut to win” his seat, despite admitting – amid the snowballing political betting scandal – that he had placed an £8,000 wager on himself to lose. Fittingly, his new venture shared a partial name with a horse he once co-owned called Nessen Dorma, according to a racing publication. But Davies, who did not return requests for comment, was far from the only Conservative MP hedging his bets. At least a dozen Tory MPs set up their own management consultancies or public relations businesses in 2024, as they faced up to the prospect of life after politics, according to Guardian analysis. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing or conflict of interest on the part of the MPs. Rather, Companies House filings suggest that many were lining up what appeared to be new earning opportunities. Some did so as electoral defeat loomed, others after standing down and still more did so in the days immediately after Labour’s landslide victory. Rishi Sunak called the election on 22 May, in the pouring rain outside Downing Street, announcing that the country would go to the polls in early July. That same day, the former Conservative MP Julian Knight set up a new business, DWR174 Consulting Ltd. Knight had been suspended from the party over allegations of sexual impropriety, which he denies, but went on to contest his Solihull constituency as an independent candidate. He did not respond to requests for comment. Some MPs had already incorporated new businesses in the months before the election, which was called early but had to be held by January 2025 at the latest. Marcus Fysh, who would declare the Conservative party “dead” in the aftermath of the vote, appeared to be preparing for life after politics in March, when he incorporated an “information technology consultancy”. Fysh said the company was set up to “handle some of the investments I have been making in artificial intelligence and software engineering”. The former Conservative MP William Wragg, who was embroiled in a honeytrap sexting scam earlier this year, had incorporated a management consultancy called Hammerbrace Ltd three months before that, in partnership with colleague Charles Walker. Days after it emerged that Wragg had given out MPs’ numbers to someone who apparently extorted him after they met on a dating app, Wragg applied to strike Hammerbrace from the corporate register. The plan to set up a consultancy appeared to have hit the buffers. Wragg did not return a request for comment. The details of MPs’ plans for work outside politics have emerged as the new Labour government prepares to put forward legislation to tighten up the rules on what work members of the House of Commons can perform other than public service. The proposals, which were approved by the Commons on Thursday last week, would prevent MPs from taking on second jobs that fail to meet a new test of putting constituents first. Former ministers and senior civil servants receive advice on appointments they wish to take up within two years on leaving government by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). The independent body scrutinises any potential conflict of interest, recent access to privileged information, or opportunity to lobby the government. The former defence secretary Ben Wallace set up Glenfiddich Consulting on 8 April this year, after announcing his intention to stand down. He told the Guardian that the company was set up to receive payment for freelance work, such as speaking engagements about geopolitics. He was one of several MPs who incorporated new companies after announcing their departure from politics but while still serving their constituents, according to Companies House filings, with April proving a busy month. Alok Sharma, the former business secretary who also chaired the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, set up the Office of Alok Sharma in March of this year. He did not return a request for comment. Management consultancies were by far the most common choice of new venture for MPs who had announced their intention to stand down. Stephen Hammond, Will Quince and Mark Pawsey set up Vineyard Consultants, Will Quince Ltd and MP Strategic Consulting respectively in April. They did not return requests for comment. Two days before the election, Andrew Percy set up Kitsilano Consulting Ltd. He declined to comment. Several MPs who did contest the 4 July vote busied themselves with new business ventures in the days immediately after losing their seats. Amanda Solloway set up Amanda Solloway Ltd, Mark Jenkinson incorporated Redghyll Ltd and Anthony Browne started Grand Strategy Ltd, all within two weeks of the result. Browne, a former chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said he planned to return to regulatory affairs. “I had made no plans for life after the election for the simple reason that until election day I thought I was going to win. I have set up a company as I plan to hire and employ people as part of a hopefully thriving business,” he added. Khalid Mahmood, the only Labour MP to appear on the list, set up KN Strategic Solutions on 17 July. He told the Guardian the company was set up to receive fees earned as a senior fellow of the thinktank Policy Exchange. Incorporating a company is a legal and common way to receive fees as a freelancer in a way that legitimately minimises taxes on earnings. • This article was amended on 30 July 2024. Acoba advises only former ministers and senior civil servants on roles they wish to take up on leaving government, not MPs generally as an earlier version said. Also on 20 June Philip Davies was the candidate and former member for Shipley, not the “then honourable member” for the constituency.\n",
      "The chief executive of Vodafone has said Labour will fail to achieve its promise of nationwide access to 5G, which is essential for next-generation technology such as artificial intelligence, by 2030 if the telecom company’s £15bn merger with the rival Three UK is blocked. In its election manifesto, the government said nationwide coverage was needed by the end of the decade because the UK was falling behind other countries in terms of the investment and rollout of advanced mobile networks. The UK ranks 22 out of 25 European countries for 5G availability and download speeds, according to research published by Opensignal in February. “Everyone now talks about [things like] artificial intelligence, all of these things cannot happen without good networks,” Margherita Della Valle, the chief executive of Vodafone Group, told the Guardian. “All policymakers understand now the importance of having good quality networks. Look at Labour’s manifesto, for example … nationwide 5G by 2030. There is no doubt that a catalyst is needed to get there because it’s not going to be done [by the current market].” Vodafone’s planned merger with its smaller rival Three, which would create the UK’s largest mobile operator with more than 27 million subscribers, is being investigated by the UK competition watchdog. In April, the Competition and Markets Authority moved to launch an in-depth investigation, citing concerns that reducing the UK’s mobile landscape from four main players to three could result in price rises for consumers. Last year, the trade union Unite called the deal “terrible”, claiming that mobile phone bills could rise by as much as £300 a year if the merger was approved. However, Vodafone and Three have said that the combination of the third and fourth largest players in the market is essential to drive investment and compete against the “big two”, the EE owner, BT, and Virgin Media O2, including on competitive pricing. As part of the takeover, the companies have pledged to invest £11bn over the next decade to upgrade and expand their 5G network. “It is a really big decision for the UK, a big industrial policy decision,” Della Valle said. “Everyone thinks about the impact on telcos [telecommunications operators]. The reality is our industry is one of a handful that impacts on many other sectors, [on] everyday life. It is critical for economic growth more broadly.” In 2015, Three UK attempted a £10.25bn takeover of O2, which included a promise to freeze prices in order to gain regulatory clearance. The telecoms regulator Ofcom was an outspoken opponent of that deal, arguing that the move from four to three main players would “shift the balance of power in the market”. Competition regulators ultimately blocked the takeover. However, two years ago, Ofcom, which feeds market data and views on takeovers and mergers to the CMA, “clarified” its stance, saying its position on future potential tie-ups would be “informed by the specific circumstances of that particular merger, rather than just the number of competitors”.  Della Valle said Vodafone, which has been intensively assessing its international businesses and last year announced the largest round of job cuts in the company’s history, said that if the merger was not approved it would be forced to cut investment further. “We don’t have the scale to invest, especially for something like 5G across the board, which is what the UK needs,” she said. “The cost [of the deal being blocked] is even more constrained investment. [The deal] is going to close between now and the end of the year but the next few months are going to be the critical ones. “At the moment, the UK has been lagging behind. By creating a third scale operator – [from] the two little guys – the merger has the ability to unlock this.”\n",
      "The recent spell of warm weather after a rainy and cloudy start to the summer has provided perfect growing conditions in Britain for as much as 200 tonnes of surprise “big, juicy, luscious” strawberries heading to shop shelves, a leading supplier has said. “The cold and wet spell earlier in the year, plus the recent mini heatwave, have resulted in pushing more of our predicted crop volume into late July and early August,” said Lee Port, the chief executive of the Kent-based fruit grower Mansfields. “This will result in an abundance of strawberries – roughly an extra 40 to 50 tonnes a week until the end of August. The good news is that they are big, juicy and luscious.” In May, the trade body British Berry Growers (BBG) said tennis fans at Wimbledon, where strawberries with cream is an annual tradition, could expect juicier fruits this year after the wet and dark winter slowed growing times. Nick Marston, the chair of the BBG, said that while this year’s harvest had taken about a fortnight longer to appear on the shelves, the delay meant British-grown strawberries ripened and flowered more gradually, resulting in unusually large, juicy berries. However, despite this year’s bumper crop, the longer-term outlook for the wider industry is more worrying. Last week, the BBG warned that British growers were finding it increasingly difficult to survive amid rising costs and poor pay from supermarkets. A survey by the industry body, which represents farmers producing 95% of the berries sold in the UK, suggested that 40% of British growers of strawberries and raspberries could go out of business by the end of 2026. If problems are not addressed, the BBG warned of “a future massive reduction in the supply of fresh British berries”. More than a third of those surveyed – 37% – are already considering reducing their production or moving out of berry farming entirely, while 39% said their relationship with retailers had never been this bad, according to the study. Strawberries, along with raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, continue to be the most popular fruit item in shoppers’ baskets, with the biggest market share – at 28% – of all fruit sold in the UK. Over the past 12 months, shoppers spent a record £847m on strawberries, Kantar figures show.\n",
      "The British tech tycoon Mike Lynch has said he thought he would die in a US jail if he had not been cleared of defrauding Hewlett-Packard over a multibillion-dollar business deal. In his first interview since his acquittal last month on charges related to the $11.1bn (£8.6bn) purchase of his company Autonomy in 2011, the man once lauded as the UK’s answer to Bill Gates said that his lung condition meant he doubted he would have survived a prison term. He had been accused of duping the US technology company into overpaying for the software firm he founded. HP subsequently took an $8.8bn writedown of Autonomy’s entire value 15 months after the deal was first disclosed, alleging it had discovered “serious accounting improprieties” and blaming Lynch for perpetrating a $5bn fraud, an accusation he denied. The 59-year-old billionaire was cleared by a Californian court on 6 June of all 15 counts of fraud, which meant he avoided facing up to 25 years in a US prison. “I have various medical things that would have made it very difficult to survive, Lynch told the Sunday Times. “If this had gone the wrong way, it would have been the end of life as I have known it in any sense.” Lynch, who said he “never watched anything with prisons in it” during the 13 months he spent under house arrest in San Francisco after his extradition in May last year, said he was keen to fund a British equivalent of the Innocence Project, a US nonprofit that works to gain the release of people it believes have been wrongfully convicted. “The system can sweep individuals away,” he said. “There needs to be a contrarian possibility that’s saying: ‘Right, well, the whole world thinks you’re guilty but, actually, was that a fair conviction?’” Lynch, a science adviser to David Cameron when he was prime minister and a former non-executive director of the BBC who received an OBE for services to enterprise in 2006, spent two years fighting extradition to the US to face trial. Another item on his to-do list is to seek to address the imbalance he believes there is in the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. “It has to be wrong that a US prosecutor has more power over a British citizen living in England than the UK police do,” he said. HP was the world’s maker of personal computers when it bought Autonomy as part of a move into software. Lynch departed as Autonomy’s CEO less than a year after the takeover, as according to HP his firm had failed to meet expectations. After the writedown, HP said a senior Autonomy executive had come forward with concerns that it said had been substantiated by an investigation and referred the findings to regulators. In November 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain, Autonomy’s former vice-president of finance. The pair were accused of scheming to defraud Autonomy investors, including HP, about its true performance, financial condition and growth prospects. Both pleaded not guilty. After being extradited to the US in May last year, Lynch was ordered by a court to pay a $100m bond and put under 24-hour armed guard, deemed to be a flight risk. He and Chamberlain were cleared last month.  However, Lynch’s battle with HP continues in the UK. In 2022, HP won a six-year civil fraud case against Lynch after a high court judge ruled that he had defrauded HP by manipulating Autonomy’s accounts to inflate the value of the company. Mr Justice Hildyard, the high court judge in the case, is expected to rule on HP’s claim for $4bn in damages. The judge has said the level of damages he intends to award will be much lower. Lynch, who said that his finances were not in a “perilous situation” because of successful tech investments made by his wife on his advice, intends to appeal the ruling.\n",
      "Savers are always on the lookout for the best interest rates and the UK seems like a good bet at the moment. In recent months, the pound has climbed in value against the euro and the dollar as economists speculate that UK interest rates will remain at 5.25% for longer than previously expected. While the odds of a cut in borrowing have shortened, with a narrow majority of City analysts expecting a reduction, few outside the Square Mile believe a change is imminent. If anything, Bank officials will send sterling to even greater heights when they signal, as seems likely, that a cut remains some way off. Suren Thiru, economics director of accountancy body the ICAEW, says he still expects the Bank to lower interest rates to 4.75% by the end of the year, but “an August rate cut is looking less likely”. Charlie Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics and a former deputy governor of the Bank, says he will be surprised if the cost of borrowing was reduced this week.   Related: Britons cut back on spending despite fall in grocery inflation, says Kantar    In March, the Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) said falling inflation and a weak outlook for the economy meant it was on course to lower interest rates. The committee signalled three rate cuts this year and more to come in 2025. Then came figures showing a strong bounce back from last year’s mild recession. According to the latest S&P Global survey of the business sector, manufacturers and services companies are winning new orders and growing in confidence about the outlook for employment and profits. Adding to the sense that the economy was doing fine without lower borrowing costs, official figures for May and June revealed wages growth remained above 5.5% and firms that were laying off workers last year had begun to hire again. The Bank has a mandate from parliament to maintain inflation at about 2% over the longer term. And while the consumer prices index was 2% in May and June, there was concern that wage pressures would reverse the trend.  Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as fuel and food, is stuck above 3%. Worse, the services inflation figure, which track what businesses charge each, other remains persistently above 5%. Stephen Millard, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says: “The question is whether we are seeing enough evidence to show inflation is going to stay low.” He believes the Bank needs more time to assess the economic situation before beginning to reverse the 14 consecutive rate rises that took place between December 2021 and August last year. Bean says if he was still on the MPC, he would want more evidence that wages were going to fall and that services companies, which have passed on most of their cost increases to customers over the past two years, would stop doing so.   There are still large pockets of industry and the services sector suffering from financial distress, partly as a result of high interest bills   The MPC publishes its latest quarterly assessment of the economic outlook on Thursday and is expected to revise upwards its growth forecast for this year and next. A rise from low to moderate growth is welcome news, but is likely to disguise a deteriorating situation in the labour market, which will be characterised by rising unemployment and, about six months from now, falling wages growth. While the overall economy is growing, there are large pockets of industry and the services sector suffering from financial distress, partly as a result of high interest bills. Consumers are also reluctant to spend and businesses are shy of making investment decisions while there is uncertainty about the path of interest rates. Thiru accuses of the Bank of “dithering” when the broad picture shows the UK’s private sector is largely stagnant and desperately in need of lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank has already cut rates and the US Federal Reserve is poised to follow suit. Thiru is among many analysts who argue that the UK badly needs a boost from lower borrowing costs. “There is a pressing need to cut rates given the level of stagnation in the economy,” he says. At the last MPC meeting, only two members voted for a cut. With at least four members known to be reluctant to usher in cheaper money, the power falls to governor Andrew Bailey and the other two floating voters. If Bailey joins “the hawkish four”, judging a further delay necessary, savers will cheer. Those who have accumulated debts will need to wait.\n",
      "Rachel Reeves is preparing to throw the kitchen sink at the Conservatives. To howls of predictable outrage from the opposition benches, the chancellor will tell the Commons on Monday that Labour’s inheritance is far worse than anyone could have imagined, backed up by a Treasury audit showing £20bn in spending commitments left unaccounted for by the previous government. Despite the old Tory promise to “fix the roof when the sun is shining”, made way back in 2010, it has been clear for years that nothing of the sort happened. Reeves can hardly feign shock that the national debt is at the highest level since the 1960s, public services are crumbling and living standards have gone backwards. For several years it has been clear the Tories were engaged in one of the most elaborate works of fiscal fiction ever penned, by glossing over mounting spending challenges – from a failing NHS to collapsing school buildings – in favour of promoting fantasy tax cuts. Time was always going to catch up with the cowboy builders, cutting corners with their botched roof mending, leaving Britain wringing wet.   Related: How bad are Britain’s finances? Five questions on the state of the UK economy | Phillip Inman   Since the general election, Jeremy Hunt has admitted he wouldn’t have had scope to cut taxes this autumn, sharply contrasting with Rishi Sunak’s promises of a low-tax nirvana made only weeks earlier. Most people knew the pledges were pure bunkum anyway, desperately peddled to voters who cared more about seeing a doctor than proving the Laffer curve. Instead, Reeves’ spending audit this week is widely viewed as the chancellor paving the way for a tax-raising autumn budget. “Nothing in our manifesto is going to require us to raise taxes,” Keir Starmer had told voters. But what about in the inheritance left by the Tories? The opposition will cry duplicity. But the case for action is clear given the mess public services have been left in. Most voters were resigned to higher taxes whoever won the election, and many would welcome increases to speed the repair job. The chancellor will also make the case that most people will be protected by manifesto promises not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, which bring in the majority of revenue for the exchequer. Another big earner – corporation tax – is also off limits. Money could be found from raising taxes on capital gains, inheritances and closing pensions loopholes – measures Labour quietly explored before 4 July. On Sunday, the Resolution Foundation thinktank suggested putting up these levies could plug up to half of the £20bn fiscal hole. Reeves could also say such rises wouldn’t break a promise not to increase taxes on “working people” because it would primarily target passive income. The former Bank of England rate setter Michael Saunders reckons such a move could raise up to £25bn, with the bulk from aligning capital gains tax rates with the higher rates of income tax. However, full equalisation is something the chancellor has previously ruled out, fearing it could undermine investment in Britain. Over the weekend it was widely reported that Reeves would instead look to cancel or delay big infrastructure projects such as the building of new roads and hospitals, arguing she has inherited “unfunded” and unrealistic schemes. Yet after securing such a thumping majority, Labour could be far bolder to ensure tangible economic progress before 2029. Part of Reeves’ caution is rooted in a desire to maintain her “iron chancellor” image, drawing contrast with Liz Truss’s reckless approach. This was politically astute before the election, helping to assuage voters’ concerns about Labour that have lingered since the 2008 financial crisis. But the time has come to move on from the fiscal rule imposed by the previous Conservative government, which Reeves has stuck to so far, requiring the national debt to be falling as a share of GDP in the fifth year of forecasts. It isn’t as though this would be without precedent. The Tories changed the fiscal rules seven times since 2010 – the shortest lifespan out of 35 advanced economies – to suit political needs, and were only meeting the current ones with fantasy spending assumptions. Growing numbers of top economists see the current rule as an albatross holding Britain back, including the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane and the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Jagjit Chadha. Some are concerned that borrowing with abandon would anger the City gods, risking a repeat of the mini financial crisis triggered by Truss’s not-so-mini budget. But much also depends on circumstances. Britain still confronts an awkward reality of high levels of national debt and lacklustre economic growth. But Starmer’s administration has significantly more goodwill with the money-changers than Truss’s wrecking mob, having returned a sense of grownup government to Britain. The City not only hated Truss’s disregard for the Bank of England, Treasury, Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. Its top economists knew her £45bn of tax cuts for the rich would have no meaningful impact on growth, seeing it instead as costly inequality-stoking ideology. Should Labour wish to borrow to fix public services and boost investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure, it is more than likely the City would take a different view. Most economists know the UK’s biggest problems are with its diminished supply capacity. Borrowing today to support growth tomorrow would therefore be welcomed. For starters, Reeves could change the fiscal rules to exclude losses on the Bank’s quantitative easing programme, which Barclays estimates could add £20bn to the government’s headroom. However, the Niesr thinktank proposes a more comprehensive rethink, including reforms to discount public investment from the current targets – helping to pave the way for more spending on transport, housing and the transition to net zero. Earlier this year, the chancellor showed some acknowledgment that change was required, using her Mais lecture to say she would get the OBR to report on the long-term benefits of capital spending decisions, helping to make the case for borrowing to invest. But the chancellor should go further. Sticking to an arbitrary straitjacket is unnecessary and could throttle the kind of investment on which stronger economic growth and higher living standards depend.\n",
      "An elderly billionaire goes to war with his adult children over the future of his media empire. His only ally is his eldest son, crowned leader of his father’s enterprise after years of jostling with his siblings. In choosing a successor, the patriarch spurns three of his other children, who remain threats: when he dies, they will each have just as much power as the eldest son to shape his companies, potentially against the rightwing ideologies that have guided them for decades. Away from the public eye, he makes a dramatic move. To deliver control to his eldest son, the mogul quietly launches an extraordinary bid to alter the trust set to hand the other three influence upon his death. But they stand ready to fight. This may sound akin to HBO’s Succession, but it’s life imitating art – which was, in turn, imitating life. Rupert Murdoch, 93, the billionaire owner of News Corp and Fox Corporation who helped inspire the show, is trying to give his eldest son, Lachlan, full control of his media outlets upon his death. While his other adult children – James, Elisabeth and Prudence – will still receive equal shares of company profits, this would leave them with no say over the companies upon his death. This battle is in fact bigger than anything featured on Succession, according to Robert Thompson, a media scholar based at Syracuse University. “This is arguably the single most influential media outlet in all of the English-speaking world,” he said of News Corp and Fox. “How this turns out has a real, significant impact on real people living on planet Earth.” News Corp owns more than a hundred major and local newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post in the US, as well as the Times and the Sun in the UK. Meanwhile, Fox is the parent of Fox News, the leading conservative cable network in the US, with millions of viewers. The Murdochs’ legal fight played out in secret for months – until Wednesday, when it burst into the open. The New York Times reported on a decision from a Nevada probate commissioner, which is under seal, that Murdoch can rewrite his family’s irrevocable trust if he can prove the change is being made in good faith and benefits his heirs. The ruling sets the stage for a high-profile trial over the future of his vast array of media interests, with Murdoch and his three children slated to duke it out in court in September. Both sides, according to the Times, have bulked up on high-profile lawyers. William Barr, the former US attorney general, is helping Murdoch rewrite the trust, and he has also hired Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer who previously worked on estate cases involving Michael Jackson and Britney Spears. The feuding appears to have taken its toll on the family. When Rupert married his fifth wife in California last month, Lachlan was said to have been the only one of his four eldest children in attendance. The other two also reportedly steered clear. With Lachlan as his father’s successor, Fox News and News Corp will continue to be a conservative force. But under the trust’s current structure, the three other siblings, who are deemed more politically moderate, can push back. Murdoch is seemingly keen to avoid this prospect. Conservatism has been the backbone of his empire since its inception. It has proved to be remarkably profitable. Though Murdoch had successfully formed relationships with powerful conservative figures in Australia and the UK, it was not until Donald Trump’s ascendancy that he had close ties to the White House. Though Fox was initially dismissive of Trump, the network soon turned into his most powerful megaphone. In turn, Murdoch had direct access to a commander-in-chief. Not all of Murdoch’s children were happy about this. During Trump’s presidency, Elisabeth, Prudence and James started to drift away from their father’s politics. When Roger Ailes, the longtime Fox CEO, left the company in 2016 off the back of multiple sexual harassment allegations, James reportedly believed he could push the network in a new direction, bringing in an experienced executive who was less of an ideologue. Instead, the elder Murdoch took over as chair himself. In the summer of 2020, James – once a senior executive at News Corp – announced he was resigning from the board over “disagreements over certain editorial content”. He and his wife, Kathryn, were particularly vocal about the climate crisis and seemed to resent Fox News and News Corp’s climate denialism. “We’ve been arguing about politics since I was a teenager,” James told the Times in 2020, about his father. In 2020, James and his wife donated more than $600,000 to Biden’s campaign. Murdoch eventually crowned Lachlan as his successor. While Lachlan does not speak publicly about his personal political views, reports have said they usually lean more conservative than his father’s. And while Lachlan appears less interested than his father in political influence, he cares about profit. And Trump has been profitable. After Trump lost in 2020, his relationship with the network soured. Fox News was reporting that Joe Biden had won the election, despite Trump’s rampant claims of interference. “Very sad to watch this happen,” Trump tweeted at the time. “But they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose.” What’s good for the ratings is good for Fox’s business, and what’s good for the business is what’s good for Murdoch’s heirs – what the judge is looking for when granting Murdoch the ability to change the irrevocable trust. “It really is, can you prove what’s in the best interest of the business? Can you prove that something else is in the best interest of the business?” said Zachary Kramer, dean of Elon University School of Law, and an expert in trust and estate law. “What Rupert Murdoch’s position is going to be is: ‘We want to make decisions that are going to be in the best interest of the business, because if the business succeeds, the beneficiaries do better.’” James, Elisabeth and Prudence can argue that supporting Trump hasn’t been all that good for the network. In 2021, Dominion sued the network for $1.6bn in a defamation suit after Trump allies at the network said the voting-equipment company had been involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election. Fox News ended up settling with Dominion for $787.5m, although it was pocket change compared to the $14.9bn in revenue the wider company made during its 2023 fiscal year. Over the last year, relations between Trump and Fox seem to have thawed. Trump calls into shows more frequently, and the channel hosted a town hall with him earlier in the year. The Murdoch family’s influence has shifted in recent years. There are new media players like Newsmax, and other influential billionaires are courting Trump, like Elon Musk, owner of X, who is pumping millions into Trump’s campaign. Murdoch himself was seen largely on the sidelines at this month’s Republican national convention in Milwaukee. “There was a time where if you wanted to survive in the Republican party, you had to bend the knee to him or to others,” Donald Trump Jr said at one event at the convention. “I don’t think that’s the case anymore.”\n",
      "Cineworld has said it will close six venues across Britain as part of a plan to cut costs, as the debt-laden chain continues to struggle with the headwinds facing the cinema industry. The affected sites will be Glasgow Parkhead, Bedford, Hinckley, Loughborough, Yate and Swindon – Regent Circus. In a statement, the company said it aimed to return to profitability and “ensure a sustainable long-term future for Cineworld in the UK”. It was reported this month that the chain was considering closing 25 of its 100 cinemas as a result of its struggles with debt and the lasting impact of the Covid pandemic. The company said on Saturday that no sites had been identified for closure other than the six announced. Cineworld said the six sites had become “commercially unviable” and that the decision to close them had been made “against a background of increasingly high and unsustainable operating costs”. It said the restructuring plan would “enable it to address its lease portfolio and rental terms with landlords in the UK” as well as to seek further funding. The company said it would consult employees at the six affected sites and offer redeployment to nearby sites to as many of them as possible. It said the total number of affected sites would not be confirmed until the restructuring is approved by a court. Founded in 1995, Cineworld operates more than 100 cinemas in Britain and Ireland and employs thousands of people. After the acquisition of US chain Regal Entertainment in 2018, it became the second-largest cinema business in the world by number of screens. In 2023, it tried to sell its businesses in the US, UK, and Ireland, but did not receive any acceptable offers. Later the same year, it entered administration and delisted from the London Stock Exchange, though continued to operate its cinemas as usual. Recent years have been difficult for the whole cinema industry. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of cinema operator Vue International, told the BBC this month that there were 35% fewer films released in 2022 than in the pre-pandemic era and 20% fewer in 2023. By contrast, the period between 2017 and 2019 saw three consecutive box office world records set, he said. The industry was also hit last year by the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strike, which halted many film productions.\n",
      "Rachel Reeves will this week lay out the full cost of Conservative party economic neglect. Initial findings, according to Labour briefings, put the cost of the repair job at about £20bn, though there is also a strong hint that the final bill, when it is announced on Monday, will be much higher. The exercise is a chance for the chancellor to send a message to her own supporters to ease off on demands for extra spending. Reeves will say the Tories’ reckless and inept handling has pushed the government’s finances further into the red than was previously understood. A message will also go out to the many people who didn’t vote Labour – let’s remember that about 80% of the UK electorate didn’t put an X against the name of a Labour candidate – that the deficit in the public finances warrants some tax rises. There is growing speculation that Reeves will signal a series of wealth tax rises, possibly increasing the rate paid on capital gains and the tax on inherited wealth, as a means to plug some of the holes. The question Labour advisers are asking themselves is whether they have prepared the ground for extra taxes on wealth, and how they will be received by those who could end up paying them. More importantly, what will be the reaction of people who, rightly or wrongly, think they might be forced to pay such taxes at some time in the future.   We soldier on, not confronting the fact that a rich and powerful minority entrench their position while everyone else scrabbles to maintain their standard of living   Most of the western world now finds itself in need of a tax reset, but what is lacking is the kind of crisis that triggers a deep questioning of how we pay for public services and welfare benefits. The pandemic and a war in Europe have not been enough to spark collective soul searching about the nature of 21st-century capitalism. Even though many have changed the way they live and work – moving out of cities or back to live with parents, coping with long Covid or retiring early – most voters try to forget the pandemic ever happened. Back in 2008, there was hope that the financial crash would strengthen the argument of those who said handing tax breaks to bankers and the super-rich in search of financial gain brought only instability and a relatively small number of winners. Those voices weren’t heard and instead we soldier on, unable to confront the fact that a minority of people and businesses, by virtue of their wealth, wield tremendous power and entrench their elevated position while everyone else scrabbles to maintain some semblance of their previous standard of living. It was said during the general election campaign that Keir Starmer should invoke the memory of Clement Attlee to inject some radicalism into his programme. The postwar Labour government nationalised, invested and created new universal services, much of it paid for by higher taxes on the better-off. Starmer was asked why he shied away from following in Attlee’s footsteps when the benefits were so consequential that a prime minister in power almost 80 years ago remains a hero today. One of the main reasons is that Attlee benefited from a crisis that saw everyone suffer. Rich and poor. Young and old. Men and women. No one escaped the terrible consequences of the second world war. More recently, governments have found the money to protect the majority from the worst effects of successive crises, and in so doing, inured them to the harm done. We know global wealth inequality has risen significantly: Oxfam reports that the richest 1% has grabbed two-thirds of all new wealth created since 2020. Joe Biden has tried to make a case against trickle-down economics, talking explicitly about the need to confront the fallacious concept of wealth creation from the charitable donations, tips and occasional investments in productive jobs (as opposed to property) that characterises late-stage capitalism. Biden has proposed a 25% tax on wealth of more than $100m, calculating that it would raise $500bn over 10 years to help fund benefits such as childcare and paid parental leave. Brazil, which chairs the G20, is pushing for a minimum 2% levy on the world’s 3,000 richest billionaires. Biden argues that his tax is fair because it would push the average tax rate for America’s 1,000 billionaires from 8.2% to nearer the 25% paid by the average US worker. The same argument needs to be made in the UK. Unless the British public are convinced that the super-rich can and should pay something nearer the average tax rate, why would they countenance higher levies on their own wealth? Labour plans to tackle some of the tax loopholes used by the super-rich. That should be a starting point for a wider, government-sponsored debate about entrenched wealth and how we should tax it.\n",
      "Aerospace giants have been accused of putting profits ahead of safety as officials consider cutting the minimum number of pilots required on commercial flight decks from two to one. The move, which is currently being evaluated by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), would weaken standards to the “lowest common denominator”, the world’s largest union of airline pilots has warned. “This threat is not something that is 10, 15, 20 years away,” Capt Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents more than 78,000 pilots in the US and Canada, said. “It’s something that, quietly, Airbus, has been working on. It’s not what they are marketing it to be. “The US has the safest aviation record in the world. We need to improve the standard for everybody, not just go to the lowest common denominator.” EASA is looking at the safety of extended minimum crew operations (eMCO), where one pilot would leave the flight deck to rest during long flights, leaving one pilot at the helm. While many long-haul flights currently staff three pilots on the flight deck, so that pilots can alternate rest, eMCO would eliminate this standard. The reduction was proposed by aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Dassault. EASA is also investigating the safety of single-pilot operation for cargo flights. “Technologically, it is feasible,” Christian Scherer, CEO of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus, said in a February interview with the Sunday Times of London. “And bear in mind, if you go to a one-man cockpit, you might as well go to a zero-man cockpit. Because it all needs to cater for the eventuality that this one guy just ate a bad oyster and is incapacitated and the aeroplane has to take over. So one pilot or zero pilot is effectively the same thing.” The Air Line Pilots Association, which recently fended off efforts to raise the retirement age of pilots from 65 to 67, sees a potential reduction in the number of pilots on the flight deck as a big, emerging safety threat. The union published a report in June on the concerns over efforts to reduce the number of pilots on the flight deck of commercial aircraft, cautioning that there is “no replacement” for the safety benefits of having “at least” two pilots on the flight deck at all times. Workloads and fatigue would increase if single pilot flights were permitted, the report argues, adding that the risks posed by the incapacitation of a pilot would increase. In a statement, the European safety agency said: “For EASA, the overriding consideration is that safety must not be compromised. Operations must therefore be demonstrably at least as safe as the current two-pilot operations are today to gain approval.” The agency noted there is no firm timeline on introducing a pilot-reducing operation. The possibility of pilot reductions wouldn’t occur until at least 2027, but could have global implications and impact flights to and from Europe and the rest of the aviation industry. Airbus and Dassault did not respond to requests for comment. “Everything that’s being driven when you look at crew sizes and inspections, it’s really driven by profit motive, it is not driven by safety,” said Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO’s transportation trades department. “That’s been true in railroads. It’s true in aviation. It’s the reason why the oversight inspections of Boeing were so lacking. It was geared towards: ‘how do we maximize profit on this?’ And we’ve seen it go way too far.” Labor unions continue to push back against efforts by the railroad industry – which was rocked last year by an explosive fire from a derailed train carrying hazardous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio – to reduce crew members on freight trains from two to one. The railroad industry is currently suing the US Department of Transportation after it finalized a rule in April 2024 first proposed under the Obama administration to mandate a minimum of two crew on railroad freight in the US. Should Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election, the rule “is certainly something that could be subject to change”, added Regan, unless legislation is passed codifying the requirement into law. Under the Trump administration in 2019, regulators withdrew the two-person crew rule and nullified all state laws that mandated the two-person crew minimum. “East Palestine was a perfect example of why and how two crews are necessary because of how they worked together to make sure the disaster wasn’t worse,” said Regan. “There’s a reason why we have regulators and lawmakers who are putting safety legislation in place and there’s a reason why qualified and professional pilots, engineers, conductors are so vital to ensuring that we have safe operations of every transportation system in our country. “To take the profit motives into account as seriously as you do the safety motives, I think, would be really foolish.”\n",
      "Eurostar passengers hoping to catch the start of the Paris Olympics have continued to face difficulties after an arson attack in France caused train cancellations. People travelling by Eurostar from London to Paris on Friday were asked to postpone trips if possible after the rail operator cancelled one in four trains over the weekend as a result of arson attacks that lead to widespread disruption to France’s high-speed rail network hours before the start of the Olympics. On Saturday Eurostar cancelled four of the 15 trains scheduled to travel from London to Paris, affecting more than 3,000 passengers, and the operator also warned of delays. It was encouraging affected passengers to “postpone their trip if possible”. There were no remaining seats for services on Saturday.   Related: ‘Dream with us’: Bach delivers message of hope as rain fails to ruin Paris parade   Prices for buses to the French capital have soared, with seats from London to Paris selling for as much as £200. All Flixbus and National Express services on the route for Saturday have been booked. The next coach with availability leaves London at 2am on Sunday. Anyone hoping to catch the Flixbus service will need to pay £198 for a seat. On Saturday morning, passengers at St Pancras station were desperately trying to get alternative tickets to the French capital. One worried Parisian mother said the cancellation of Friday’s 4.31pm train meant her 12-year-old daughter was waiting alone in a cafe in Paris after a plan to pick her up on Saturday morning fell through. Zissia Patel, 46, a university administrator who has been visiting family in London, said: “My daughter is alone in a cafe in Paris so I want to be with her. She’s only 12.”  She said she had been told she could not rebook a different train online and had to come in to St Pancras instead. “I’m just trying to keep calm. My child is alone in a cafe,” she said. Olivia Atwell was in tears as she waited behind Patel in the slow-moving Eurostar queue. The 26-year-old Australian said she had not slept since getting on a 5.40am flight from Sydney to London on Friday to watch her cousin Amy compete in the women’s basketball at the Olympics. Atwell, an accountant from Sydney, said: “I’ve not slept. If I don’t get a train I’ll get a flight to Paris.” People also shared their travel woes on social media. Jeremy Bourton wrote on X that he could lose up to £4,000 after his Eurostar train was cancelled. Tagging the Eurostar account, he said: “Can I please get confirmation that you will pay compensation for our accommodation, Olympic events? Totalling around £3,500/£4,000 in total.” The comedian Matt Green said he had been “looking forward to going to the Olympics for years” and booked Eurostar tickets from London to Paris as soon as the French capital was announced as the competition’s 2024 host city. He wrote on X that both of his trains had been cancelled. “Looks like I won’t be going to the Olympics,” he wrote. “Pretty upset that a thing I’ve been planning to do for literally years has just fallen apart.” Despite the disruption, travellers had kind words for Eurostar staff dealing with the chaos. Michelle Macleod had been hit with a five-hour delay. “Well that idea to take Eurostar to Paris instead of flying to avoid chaos didn’t really work,” she said. She was eventually placed on a later service. She wrote on X. “[Eurostar] staff were brilliant at St Pancras and on the train – in very difficult circumstances!”\n",
      "Even in a room full of generals from around the world decked in military braid, the arrival of the prime minister causes a stir. At the Farnborough international airshow this week, knots of advisers and armed police surrounded Keir Starmer as he walked through the stalls, occasionally allowing a favoured chief executive or a nervous apprentice into the inner circle. A few words with the prime minister will always be valuable for bosses of big business. But at this year’s version of the biennial aviation and weapons show, defence companies in particular were hanging on his words for any hints of the intentions of the first Labour prime minister since 2010. Labour was out in force at the airshow, with a record number of cabinet ministers attending only a couple of weeks after they were appointed. Starmer tried to flatter executives, telling them that “some of your fingerprints are on our plan” for economic growth. Yet beyond the warm words, the new government has a host of questions to answer on what the future of UK defence policy will look like – and whether more of the billions it plans to spend on weapons can be used as a tool to spur Labour’s goal of boosting economic growth. Defence bosses are hoping for those answers to come quickly. Labour is carrying out a strategic defence review, due to be completed in the first half of next year, in which all large industrial contracts will be closely scrutinised, according to a party source. The review will no doubt consider how best to maintain an effective UK military capability and boost manufacturing employment. However, the defence sector also presents ethical dilemmas, most obviously with growing calls for a ban on UK arms exports to Israel, amid the huge civilian death toll in Gaza. Tufan Erginbilgiç, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, told reporters at the show that he was “not sure it is helpful” to have a delay of at least six months before big decisions are made. Another manufacturing boss said that the defence secretary, John Healey, has insisted the review will not slow down big programmes that have already started. Fighter jets and exports Rolls-Royce supplies engines for the UK’s jet fighters, including the Typhoon and some F35s that make up the bulk of British air power. But it is also a key partner in the Tempest fighter jet programme, alongside the British manufacturer BAE Systems, Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Italy’s Leonardo. The three countries are planning to deliver the first of the sixth generation of fighter jets by 2035 – half the time it took to develop Typhoon. Tempest has made it to concept stage, but some senior defence industry figures believe it should not proceed in its current form. France, Germany and Spain are making a rival fighter, the Future Combat Air System (FCAS). Before the show, Michael Schoellhorn, the boss of Airbus’s defence business, said it did not normally make sense for Europe to make two separate fighters rather than sharing development costs with close allies. Airbus works on FCAS, but it has also previously asked to join the Tempest programme, according to a senior defence industry source. Starmer did not fully commit to building Tempest – a stance that could well help in later negotiations over costs. However, he told bosses at the show that Tempest, also known as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), is “an important programme” and was making “significant progress”.  The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, was warmer, telling reporters the government was “very strongly committed to it” and “see it as essential for the future, not just in terms of our defence needs, but obviously our industrial needs”. Erginbilgiç said he believed the UK would continue with Tempest, which he said was about “defence capability and not relying on others”. But he also stressed the possible benefit to UK GDP growth, including potential exports of the Tempest fighter. Saudi Arabia has already asked to buy into GCAP, and other military allies in Europe and the Middle East might be interested. “There is a big economic growth angle in this, right?” said Erginbilgiç . “Because right now, I have 1,000 people working on GCAP, and I’m not at peak yet.” Thousands more jobs would be scattered through the supply chain. Exports feed straight into higher GDP, so would be attractive for a government committed to growth. Yet exporting Tempest to Saudi Arabia could prove politically tricky for a Labour government. BAE has a relationship with the Saudi government that stretches back decades and encompasses al-Yamamah, the UK’s biggest ever arms deal. The company employs more than 5,000 staff in the country to provide technical assistance, training and service the Saudi air force’s Typhoon fighter jets. However, the al-Yamamah deal was dogged by allegations of corruption. More recently, the former Conservative government resisted pressure to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, over the use of UK-supplied weapons by a Saudi-led military coalition against civilians in Yemen. Germany has blocked sales of Typhoon fighter to the Saudis, to the chagrin of executives including Erginbilgiç and the Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury. Germany introduced the ban after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, but other countries have proven more willing to ignore past human rights abuses. The UK under the Conservatives was a key champion of Saudi Arabia joining GCAP. It is unclear whether that will change under Labour. British bias Before taking office, Starmer’s Labour had spent years persuading voters that it had changed since the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, a longtime critic of military action and industry making money from products that kill people. By contrast, Starmer became the first Labour leader in at least 30 years – and probably much longer – to visit BAE Systems’ nuclear submarine factory in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and ministers have made great efforts to court the defence industry. The reputation of the defence industry has benefited from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The return of major conflict to Europe has prompted a reappraisal by governments, and reportedly also some investors who had previously avoided weapons manufacturers on ethical grounds. Despite complaints of straitened finances, the government has promised to increase the UK’s defence budget to 2.5% of GDP, but it has not said exactly when it will hit that target. However, ministers have made it clear that they want defence spending to benefit the UK more, such as by favouring British companies for defence procurement, and increasing the weight given to businesses that provide British jobs when assessing bids. That is “music to my ears”, said the boss of one major defence manufacturer. “Industrial strategy under the last government had become a dirty word.” UK-based manufacturers hoping to win new business are unsurprisingly thrilled by the prospect of British factories being favoured for future contracts. One of those contracts is a plan to buy a new medium-sized helicopter. It is a three-way battle between Leonardo, which owns the former AgustaWestland factory in Yeovil, Airbus and the US manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Adam Clarke, the managing director of Leonardo Helicopters UK, said Labour’s promises to favour British businesses was “absolutely the right message”. Leonardo is the only one of those three that builds helicopters from scratch in the UK. “As a taxpayer, we should be looking at social value and the economic benefit to the UK,” he said. Diane Shaw, a former Ministry of Defence official who is now a partner at the consultancy AlixPartners, said businesses could be persuaded to invest in the UK if the government had a clear industrial strategy. “I think they’ll have to make some hard decisions, but we have a great base of engineering capability that could be exploited – if they start to push and develop that industrial strategy,” she said. Yet at some point the Labour government may have to choose between benefiting Britain’s manufacturers, or getting the best value for money. The government got an early crash course in that tension when it last week decided not to offer financial support to the struggling Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The decision by the business secretary raises questions over the yard’s survival, and its ability to fulfil a £1.6bn warship contract. Yet Reynolds said he was confident that Royal Navy warships would continue to be built in Belfast. If the budgets of building fighter jets, tanks or ships rise – as they tend to do – then the government could face more politically tricky decisions with direct implications on UK jobs. As one British defence industry boss at the show warned: “It can’t be ‘British at any cost’.”\n",

      "  3.19pm BST  Closing summary  Former Post Office and Royal Mail chairman Allan Leighton gave testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, saying he was “absolutely horrified” at the miscarriage of justice but was kept in the dark. Leighton, who held roles from 2001 to 2009, also said that the Horizon IT system was described as “fit for purpose” in every board meeting he attended during his nine year stint. The inquiry also heard from Paula Vennells’ former chief of staff, Martin Edwards, who is still employed at the Post Office. Evidence at the inquiry revealed that he wrote a “setting the hares” running email for Vennells to use to minimise questions from the board as the prospect of a wave of appeals against unsafe prosecutions by subpostmasters was raised in a key report by forensic accountants Second Sight. Elsewhere, NatWest has paid £2.4bn to buy rival Metro Bank’s mortgage book, and revealed it spent £24m on the Sir Trevor McDonald-fronted share sale campaign that was axed ahead of the general election. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said drivers are still paying too much for fuel, with increases in retailers’ fuel margins costing consumers £1.6bn last year. The UK competition regulator also said that it is “unlikely” that supermarkets are iinflating prices to make loyalty card holder deals look misleadingly attractive. Drax Group, the UK’s largest source of renewable energy, reported a 37% increase in profits in the first six months and announced a two-year, £300m share buyback scheme.

The public inquiry into how the scandal has heard how Martin Edwards, Vennell’s chief of staff between 2012 and 2014, was one of a handful of trusted lieutenants who regularly worked up briefs for use by top executives defending the Post Office and Horizon IT system as evidence mounted that it was faulty. Ahead of the official publication of the interim report by Second Sight, in which the forensic accountants raised serious issues about Horizon with findings that could open the door to mass appeals for wrongful prosecutions, Edwards was heavily involved in preparing Vennell’s explanation to the board. “Obviously the points about the ombudsman and past prosecutions could set the hares running,” Edwards wrote in an email to Vennells and former Post Office general counsel Susan Crichton. “Suggested draft email for the board below.” Counsel for the public inquiry suggested that Edwards “set the hares running” comment and subsequent draft email was an attempt to ensure that the board did not start investigating the Horizon IT scandal and prosecutions. “I was absolutely referring to the potential reaction of the board,” said Edwards in his testimony. “I don’t think I am saying there is anything wrong with them asking questions. This was as I understood it going further than Paula had briefed the board previously. “At the time the view of the business wasn’t that previous prosecutions had been unsound. This email reflects the mindset of the business at the time. Clearly there wasn’t enough focus on the safety of those prosecutions and the human impact.” In his witness statement Edwards repeatedly referred to his role as being simply a “conduit” for his bosses, that he always checked with “subject experts” before briefs or emails he created were used, and that he did not have any did not have any “specific decision-making accountabilities”. However, a string of examples of emails and brief writing tasks, often with the Post Office head of communications Mark Davies, showed that he frequently took a lead role in formulating briefs. At one point counsel for the inquiry suggested he might change his witness statement to more accurately say he was “deeply involved” in orchestrating the Post Office position on Horizon. “What I am not doing is unilaterally altering [a] brief and putting it to Paula,” he said. “I co-ordinated it. I held the pen on it.” Following the publication of Second Sight’s interim report in July 2013 Edwards took exception to a BBC headline saying that the Horizon IT system caused postmasters to lose money every year. He emailed the Post Office team suggesting that it be corrected calling the BBC “arseholes”. “That was a bit of an uncharacteristic email from me,” he said. “There was clearly a strong conviction at the time in the integrity of Horizon. I don’t think at that point in time I would have particularly recognised it as a ‘them versus us’ mindset. It was clearly one of those emails you regret. It was an overreaction.” Edwards remains employed at the Post Office in the role of network strategy and delivery director where he said he liaises with subpostmasters.  Updated at 6.27pm BST    1.10pm BST  Supermarkets are \"unlikely\" to be inflating prices to make loyalty card holder deals look misleadingly attractive, says competition watchdog  Initial analysis of thousands of grocery prices indicates it is unlikely that supermarkets are artificially inflating the price of everyday goods to make the prices for loyalty card holders appear misleadingly attractive, according to the competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority said it was still scanning tens of thousands of prices and has commissioned a consumer survey to understand the impact of loyalty pricing on how we shop, including how much people shop around and compare prices. It is also examining how supermarkets’ loyalty prices compare to those prices charged by rivals at the same point in time. It expects to report on its findings in November. Last year, the body began an investigation into the effect on consumers of the rise of loyalty card price cuts amid concerns that they could limit competition and lead to price rises for shoppers not signed up to such marketing schemes. Sainsbury’s began offering special discounts for its Nectar card holders last spring when the Co-op also brought in members’ pricing on some core products, while Tesco has ramped up use of its Clubcard discounts so that it now covers thousands of products. Lidl launched a loyalty scheme in 2020 and updated it in 2022 so that shoppers had to spend more to get the top level of discounts. The CMA will also publish interim findings on its study into pricing on infant formula this autumn and a final report in February next year as it said it wanted to engage with new administrations across the UK following the election. The studies are part of a wider look at whether supermarkets used soaring inflation on the cost of goods to mask an effort to increase their own profits. On Friday the CMA said continued monitoring of supermarkets’ profit margins showed that they had increased in the past year but remained “broadly at or below” 2020 levels.  Updated at 2.00pm BST    11.47am BST  Former Post Office chair says Horizon called \"fit for purpose\" in every board meeting  A former chair of Royal Mail and the Post Office has said the fitness for purpose of the Horizon IT system was discussed at every board meeting, but never once were signifcant faults, bugs or legal actions raised in his nine year tenure. Allan Leighton, who worked for Royal Mail and the Post Office from 2001 to 2009, said that the constant discussion of Horizon was the “most significant oversight” of an IT system he had ever seen. Sam Stevens, counsel for the Horizon IT inquiry, asked Leighton how often the “fitness for purpose” of Horizon came up in board meetings. “All of the time,” said Leighton. “The most significant thing about this Horizon project… is that there [was] not a board meeting that goes by that it is not talked about. The amount of oversight on Horizon was extremely high. I feel very confident having read all the papers and reminded myself that the oversight of the Horizon project was more significant than I have seen on any IT project. There [was] not a board meeting of Royal Mail or the Post office where Horizon [was] not discussed. However, Leighton said that two significant legal cases undertaken by the Post Office that cast doubt on the resilience of the Horizon system that he said should have been raised to board level were not. In 2004, the Post Office settled without prosecution in a case that contained an expert report suggesting there were problems with Horizon. In 2006, in the case of Lee Castleton, one of the most high-profile civil suit that resulted in the post office operator being made bankrupt over an alleged £25,000 shortfall, Castleton testified that there were no losses and that Horizon was to blame. Leighton said that the cases should “absolutely” have been discussed at board level. “Systemic issues and some of bugs that [eventually] came out were never brought to me or the board’s attention,” he said. “That should have come up via the operation and legal functions.”  Updated at 2.27pm BST    10.52am BST  Former Royal Mail and Post Office chair Allan Leighton \"absolutely horrified\" by Horizon IT scandal but says he was kept in the dark  Allan Leighton, the former chairman of the Royal Mail and Post Office, has said that he is “absolutely horrified” by the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of subpostmasters but was not made aware of problems with the Horizon IT system or the scale of legal action. Leighton, who worked at the two organisations between 2001 and 2009, expressed “heartfelt sympathies to all those so terribly affected by these miscarriages of justice”. “I have been absolutely horrified by the information I have seen subsequently emerge about the improper prosecution of subpostmasters,” he said in a witness statement. However, Leighton said that he was never made aware of problems with the Horizon IT system and was never told about the scale of the private prosecution strategy the Post Office management was pursuing. “We had no idea of the numbers of prosecutions that were taking place,” he told the inquiry on Friday. “That was never raised up [to the board] over a long period of time. “[There was] never a discussion about the number of prosecutions taking place at the Post Office itself. It was never seen as an issue in the organisation. This was not a priority at the time.” Leighton said that there were “clearly procedures that should have taken place” and it was a “mistake” for teams working on the prosecutions not to raise it to board level. “Boards tend to react to significant issues,” he said. “It was never flagged up. The issue was there was nothing coming to the board from any direction.” Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office relentlessly pursued branch owner-operators across the UK for alleged theft, fraud and false accounting, despite knowing there were faults in Horizon IT accounting software installed by Fujitsu in the late 1990s. In total, some 3,500 sub-postmasters and mistresses were wrongly accused of taking money from their businesses, with more than 900 prosecuted in harrowing court cases despite protesting their innocence and raising issues with the IT system in their defence. The scandal has often been described as the most widespread carriage of misjustice in UK history.  Updated at 10.56am BST    9.58am BST  Allan Leighton gives evidence at the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry  Allan Leighton, the former chair of Royal Mail and the Post Office, has started his testimony at the public inquiry into the scandal. Leighton was affiliated to the Royal Mail between 2001 and 2009, and the Post Office between 2002 and 2009. He was the Royal Mail chairman when some of the cases wrongly prosecuting post officer operators, because of incorrect information from the Horizon IT system, were brought to court. Leighton gave testimony to the inquiry in April. However, due to a technical fault with the recording, he has returned to confirm his evidence. He may give new answers, or change his testimony, as the inquiry continues this morning.

Updated at 12.25pm BST    9.26am BST  Drax reports 37% increase in profits and plans to return £300m to shareholders  Drax Group, the UK’s largest source of renewable energy, has reported profits of £463m in the six months to the end of June, up from £338m in the same period last year. The performance prompted the company, which announced a two-year £300m share buyback scheme starting in the next quarter, to up its full year profit forecast to the top end of analyst expectations. Shares in Drax, which in January received permission from the government to fit carbon capture technology to its wood-burning power plant in a project that could cost bill-payers more than £40bn, surged 12% in early trading a investors responded positively to the results. Will Gardiner, chief executive of Drax, said:  Drax has delivered a strong operational performance, playing an important role supporting the UK energy system with dispatchable, renewable power, keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.  Drax, which has converted four coal-power units to use biomass and operates hydro power projects, is set to see the end of a government subsidy for biomass generation in 2027.

All high speed trains to and from the French capital are being diverted via the classic line today, extending the journey time by about 90 minutes, the company said. Several trains have been cancelled. A spokesperson for SNCF, the French rail operator, said:  This is a massive attack on a large scale to paralyse the TGV network.

The regulator said that retail margins remain “significantly” above historic levels, a year after criticising the market for failing customers. The CMA said that retailers’ fuel margins - the difference between what they pay for their fuel and the price they sell it at - remain high with supermarkets’ fuel margins roughly double what they were in 2019. Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said:  Last year we found that competition in the road fuel market was failing consumers, and published proposals that would revitalise competition amongst fuel retailers. One year on and drivers are still paying too much.  The RAC said that it has already written to the new energy secretary to try to get action taken on the issue, following the findings of the third monitoring report by the CMA. Simon Williams, head of policy at the RAC, said:  To see that drivers have paid £1.6bn more than they should have in the last year is nothing short of outrageous, especially when so many are dependent on their vehicles. Drivers have every right to feel ripped off, especially knowing there is virtually no market competition between retailers. Our analysis has long shown that even accounting for retailers’ increased operating costs, margins on fuel are at extremely questionable levels.   Updated at 12.25pm BST    7.57am BST  NatWest buys Metro Bank mortgage book for £2.4bn and spent £24m on axed share sale campaign  Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. NatWest was forced to spend £24m on the former Tory government’s shelved “Tell Sid” campaign featuring Sir Trevor McDonald to promote the sale of the bank’s shares to the public. NatWest’s bill for the campaign, which was set to launch within days of Rishi Sunak announcing the surprise early summer election which scuppered the roll-out, was revealed as it also announced that it has acquired a raft of mortgages from Metro Bank for £2.4bn. The bank was forced to stump up for part of what would have been a £10m-plus advertising push - which included TV ads featuring the veteran newsreader and presenter popping up around the UK asking the public “Are you in?” – because of agreements with the government dating back to the tax-payer funded bailout in 2008. NatWest has had to pay for part of the preparation costs for the sale, including toward the production of the advertising, printing and distributing documents, as well as legal fees and expenses. The campaign was part of the Tory party’s efforts to return the bank - formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – to private ownership by 2025-26, following its £46bn taxpayer bailout during the height of the financial crisis. There were also hopes that the campaign would encourage everyday savers to start investing in British stocks. The nationwide push had been originally intended as a “pre-election sweetener” to help the Tories.

      "UK motorists are still being overcharged for fuel, according to the competition watchdog, which said they paid £1.6bn more than they should have last year alone. In its cost of living report, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded that prices at the pump were still too high, and that the lack of proper competition among fuel retailers was “failing consumers”. Retailers’ fuel margins, which are the difference between what a retailer pays for fuel compared with what is charged to drivers, are “still significantly above historic levels”, the report said, with margins at supermarkets roughly double what they were in 2019. That meant motorists were paying £1.6bn more for petrol and diesel in 2023 when compared with margins in 2019, the CMA said – a £700m jump from the £900m in extra charges in 2022. The CMA chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said the findings were “concerning” and that “high road fuel prices put pressure on households and businesses”. The watchdog said it reinforced the need for a legally binding fuel finder scheme, which would give drivers access to live, station-by-station road fuel prices on satnavs, map apps or fuel finder apps. Last year the CMA found that drivers were paying more for petrol and diesel than before the pandemic because of “weakened” competition. In January, the government announced plans to force fuel retailers to share near-live information on price changes at the pump to help drivers find the cheapest petrol and diesel. But efforts to put those rules into law were scrapped during May’s pre-election wash-up: a period in the parliamentary process when legislation is swiftly pushed through before the country goes to the polls.  The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: “To see that drivers have paid £1.6bn more than they should have in the last year is nothing short of outrageous, especially when so many are dependent on their vehicles. Drivers have every right to feel ripped off, especially knowing there is virtually no market competition between retailers. “The CMA couldn’t be any clearer about what needs to happen,” Williams added. “We have already written to the new energy secretary, urging him to implement its recommendations as quickly as possible. “This means greater transparency of fuel prices from all retailers and, most importantly of all, a price monitoring body that can take decisive action on retailers whenever drivers are overcharged. This can’t happen soon enough.” The British Retail Consortium said its members would work with the regulator on fuel pricing. Its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: “Supermarkets remain focused on delivering the best overall value for their customers across all products that they sell, including food and petrol. “Retailers will continue to work closely with the CMA and provide the necessary data to allow consumers to find the best prices for petrol and diesel.” The CMA’s findings on fuel were part of a wider study into whether supermarkets have been ramping up profits during a period of high inflation. On Friday the regulator said its continued monitoring of supermarkets’ profit margins showed they had increased in the past year but remained “broadly at or below” 2020 levels. Initial analysis of thousands of grocery prices indicated it was unlikely that supermarkets were artificially inflating the price of everyday goods to make the prices for loyalty card holders appear misleadingly attractive, the CMA said. It will publish a full report on its findings in November and will provide an update in the autumn on pricing for baby formula, another key product that has been subject to high inflation.\n",
      "Eurostar passengers travelling from London to Paris on Friday were asked to postpone trips if possible as the rail operator cancelled one in four trains over the weekend after arson attacks caused widespread disruption to France’s high-speed rail network hours before the start of the Olympics. Most cross-Channel services were leaving St Pancras International station on time but journeys were expected to be prolonged by at least an hour in France.  After initially cancelling two Friday afternoon departures from London, the operator warned that it would have to cancel 25% of its scheduled trains across its European network throughout the weekend. The disruption, caused by what French authorities described as coordinated and malicious attacks on rail infrastructure between Paris and Lille, came hours before the Games’ opening ceremony, potentially stranding some passengers hoping to attend.   Related: Paris prepares for Olympics opening ceremony spectacle along River Seine   Among those affected was the prime minister. Keir Starmer was due to take the cross-Channel train to attend the opening ceremony but flew to Paris instead, according to a Downing Street spokesperson.   Interactive  Eurostar said it would attempt to ensure passengers could reach their destinations, despite long diversions on to slower tracks. The rail operator said in a statement: “Due to coordinated acts of malice in France, affecting the high-speed line between Paris and Lille, all high-speed trains going to and coming from Paris are being diverted via the classic line today Friday 26 July. “This extends the journey time by around an hour and a half. Eurostar expects this situation will last until Monday morning. Today, Eurostar will cancel 25% of its trains. It will also be the case on Saturday 27 and Sunday 28. “Eurostar’s teams are fully mobilised in stations, in the call centres and onboard to ensure that all passengers are informed and can reach their destination. We encourage our customers to postpone their trip if possible.” Passengers would be able to cancel or get a refund or change their journey free of charge, Eurostar said. The disruption has left some passengers anxious about their chances of making the opening ceremony. Hadassa Goncalves, 24, who was due to travel via London from São Paulo, Brazil, told the PA news agency that her train would now not reach Paris Gare du Nord until nearly 5pm, adding: “We want to see the opening ceremony. This is bad for us. We don’t have tickets but we want to see the fireworks.” Another Eurostar passenger, Kate Fisher, 37, from Louisiana, US, who was travelling to Paris with five friends to watch the Games, told PA: “We knew this is absolutely the worst time to go to Paris because of the Olympics so we’re prepared for it to take longer. When I saw the delay on the departure board, I was like: ‘whatever, as long as we’re there.’” Most of Team GB’s athletes due in Paris for the opening ceremony had already arrived by Eurostar. The British Olympic Association said that only two athletes were scheduled to travel on Friday and had arrived with only minor delays. The French state-owned railway company SNCF has also advised passengers to postpone journeys where possible. Eurotunnel’s Le Shuttle service is unaffected.\n",
      "The owner of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire will give shareholders a £300m windfall after a sharp rise in taxpayer subsidies boosted its profits for the first half of the year to more than £500m. The power station, which receives hefty subsidies from burning biomass wood chips, mainly shipped from North America, generated almost a third more electricity over the first half of this year compared with the same months last year. This earned Drax Group £393m in biomass subsidies, which are opposed by many climate campaigners who claim that burning biomass is not sustainable and may increase carbon emissions. The company has received more than £6bn in subsidies for its biomass plant, the UK’s biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide. Drax, which supplies about 5% of the UK’s electricity, has called on the government to continue supporting its power plant by extending the subsidy scheme, which is due to end in 2027, until the end of the decade. From 2030, Drax expects to earn subsidies through a new scheme designed to support its plan to fit carbon capture technology to the power plant, in a project that could cost bill payers more than £40bn. The plans have been backed by National Grid’s electricity system operator and the UK’s independent Climate Change Committee as an important element in the UK’s efforts to meet its 2050 climate targets. In total, the company’s adjusted earnings climbed to £515m for the six months to the end of June, up from £417m in the first half of last year. The company said rising profits would continue in the second half of the year to reach “the top end” of the City’s expectations for its full-year results. In addition to buying back £300m of its shares, the company also promised to increase dividends by 12.6%, more than expected by City analysts, which ignited a share price leap of 11% on Friday morning. Matt Williams, a campaigner for Cut Carbon Not Forests and the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: “It is unacceptable that this company is burning the world’s forests and making money hand over fist from environmental harm. “A large part of those profits come from public subsidies Drax is given by claiming that burning forests is good for the planet. Worse than that, Drax has told the government it needs more subsidies after 2027 – at the same time as handing hundreds of millions of pounds to shareholders. Every time you pay your energy bill, you help pay Drax’s subsidies.” Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax Group, said the power plant was playing an important role in the UK’s electricity system by “keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses, while supporting thousands of jobs throughout our supply chain”. Drax claims burning wood pellets is carbon neutral because trees absorb as much carbon dioxide when they grow as they emit when they are burned. Capturing the carbon emissions from biomass power plants would then effectively create “negative carbon emissions”, according to Drax. These claims are disputed by environmentalists. Simon Francis, a campaigner at the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said Drax was profiting from a “broken energy system” and called on companies that have benefited financially from the energy crisis to “contribute more to ensure the most vulnerable households are supported” and “pay a fair tax on their ever-mounting profits”. Meanwhile, the French energy company EDF posted a 15.7% rise in its first-half profit to €18.7bn (£15.8bn) after higher electricity production from its nuclear fleet and hydropower plants. It expects its profits over the second half of the year to be lower than in 2023 because of the decline in energy market prices since the energy crisis.\n",
      "NatWest was forced to spend £24m on the former Conservative government’s aborted “Tell Sid”-style campaign featuring Sir Trevor McDonald, which would have resulted in a chunk of the bank’s state-owned shares being sold to the general public in a highly anticipated privatisation drive. The price tag emerged when the bank released its second-quarter results and announced that it was snapping up a number of mortgages from the smaller rival Metro Bank for £2.4bn. Agreements with the government dating to the bank’s bailout in 2008 meant NatWest was on the hook for costs linked to the campaign, including advertising, printing and distributing documents, as well as legal fees and expenses. The Tory government had already hired a fleet of advisers, including from Goldman Sachs, Barclays, the advertising house M&C Saatchi, the law firm Freshfields and the retail share sale experts Solid Solutions, to prepare the programme. The process, which the former chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced during last year’s autumn statement, was due to launch this summer, with a big public “Tell Sid” campaign – a reference to the slogan used to encourage the public to buy shares in the newly privatised British Gas in 1986. Hunt’s plan was part of the Tories’ efforts to return the bank – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – to private ownership by 2025-26, after its £46bn taxpayer bailout during the height of the financial crisis. There were also hopes that the campaign would encourage everyday savers to start investing in British stocks. The Guardian revealed last month that TV ads had already been filmed featuring McDonald, the veteran newsreader and presenter, popping up around the UK asking the public: “Are you in?”. However, the campaign plans were abruptly cancelled in May after Rishi Sunak called an early general election. The new Labour government has not confirmed whether it will pick up where the Tories left off, leaving NatWest to shoulder the cost. However, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is reportedly leaning towards scrapping the retail share sale to focus on selling off the remaining 19.9% stake to institutional investors, including asset managers and pension funds, according to Bloomberg. The decision could end up being cheaper both for the government and bank, and could free up time and staff who would otherwise be dedicated to managing the programme. Paul Thwaite, the NatWest chief executive, declined to comment on the government’s plans but told journalists that Reeves would probably give an update during the autumn statement. “The reality is that the policy for any sort of share sale is usually set out during fiscal events. Obviously, the new government hasn’t had one, but we’d expected it to follow the next fiscal event,” Thwaite said. “But what I’d come back to is a halving of the [government’s] shares during the last six months is a really positive trajectory … Returning the bank into private hands, I believe, is in the best interest of all of our shareholders.” The figures were released as NatWest reported earnings results showing pre-tax profits slipped 4.1% to £1.7bn over the three months to the end of June, compared with a year earlier. However, that was better than the £1.3bn than analysts had forecast. The bank recorded a 2.4% drop in net interest income, which is a key measure of profitability for lenders, and accounts for the difference between what is charged for loans and what is paid out to savers, to £2.8bn, beating expectations of £2.6bn. The bank had also been expected to put aside £161m for potential defaults but instead released £45m, thanks to the UK’s improving economic outlook. It helped push NatWest shares up by as much as 9.1% at one point on Friday, hitting its highest level since February 2015. NatWest also hoovered up 10,000 new customers through the acquisition of Metro Bank’s prime mortgage book. It is Thwaite’s second acquisition this summer, after striking a deal to buy most of Sainsbury’s Bank in June. The Co-operative Bank released its financial results on Friday , showing a 60% drop in first-half profits to £24.2m. The bank, which is being sold by its hedge fund owners to Coventry Building Society for £780m, said the fall in profits was due to lower income in a period marked by heightened competition for fewer mortgage customers. It was also hit by higher costs linked to higher salaries, reimbursing fraud victims, and levies paid to the Bank of England.\n",
      "Democrats introduced a bill Friday proposing increased penalties for employers found guilty of child labor violations and toughening rules around minimum wage, overtime violations and breaches of health and safety rules. The Let’s Protect Workers act would also set new penalties for retaliating against workers who exercise their right to take family and medical leave, toughen oversight of workplace injury records, improve mine safety and ensure funding for workers affected by black lung. The bill comes as child labor violations have surged in the US. The Department of Labor reported an increase of 88% in such violations between 2019 and 2023 as Republican states have moved to relax child labor rules. Eight states have passed legislation to roll back child labor protections so far this year.   Related: Republicans continue effort to erode US child labor rules despite teen deaths   For child labor violations, the US Department of Labor can currently fine employers up to $11,000 per employee who is the subject of a child labor violation and up to $50,000 for each violation that causes injury or death of a minor. The fines can be doubled if the violation is determined to be willful or repeated. The new bill would increase fines up to $150,000 per employee subject to a child labor violation and up to $700,000 for a violation that causes the death or injury of a minor, which still could be doubled for willful or repetitive violations. Wage and hour violations would increase from up to $1,100 per violation to $25,000 per violation, which may be doubled for willful or repetitive violations. “Every American should be fairly compensated and be able to return home safely at the end of the day,” said Robert “Bobby” Scott, Virginia representative and ranking Democratic member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. “Unfortunately, shortcomings in our labor laws enable unethical employers to exploit workers, endanger children and suppress the right to organize – with little accountability,” Scott said. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Let’s Protect Workers act, which will hold bad actors accountable and strengthen penalties for labor law violations. This bill will help level the playing field and, once again, restore the balance of power between workers and their employers.” The bill would also introduce civil monetary penalties for unfair labor practices committed by employers, up to $50,000 per violation. Currently, employers do not face any civil monetary penalties aside from back pay and reinstatement of workers for unfair labor practice charges. The legislation comes in the wake of a report published by Scott in April 2024 that outlined the ineffectiveness of low or non-existent civil monetary penalties for labor violations committed by employers. The report outlines how current fines and penalties are merely “a slap on the wrist”, with employers facing little to no deterrents to breaking labor laws. “Unfortunately, unscrupulous employers are emboldened to violate these foundational worker rights and protections because of the weak civil monetary penalties assessed in response,” the report noted. “Under some labor and employment laws, workers are worse off as employers face no monetary penalty and can break the law cost-free.”\n",
      "OpenAI is testing a new search engine that uses generative artificial intelligence to produce results, raising the prospect of a significant challenge to Google’s dominance of the online search market. SearchGPT will launch with a small group of users and publishers before a potential wider rollout, the company announced on Thursday. OpenAI ultimately intends to incorporate the search features into ChatGPT, rather offer a standalone product. OpenAI said SearchGPT is a temporary prototype that will combine the company’s AI models, such as ChatGPT, with the ability to search the internet. It will respond conversationally to searches, while providing up-to-date information with “clear links to relevant sources”. The search feature positions the company as a direct competitor to major search engines, most notably Google but also Bing, a product of OpenAI’s biggest investor Microsoft. Integrating generative AI into search engines has become something of an arms race among tech companies, even as AI has a track record of producing inaccurate results and posing copyright concerns. “Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,” OpenAI said in a blogpost which hailed “a new way” to search. “We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier.” Depending on how SearchGPT presents and cites the sources of its information, it risks intensifying a pushback from publishers on how OpenAI uses their content. Multiple news outlets and media organizations, including the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Intercept and a host of local papers, have taken legal action against the company in recent months over alleged copyright violations. They argue that OpenAI illegally trained its AI models on their published work without consent or compensation, profiting off of protected material and in effect plagiarizing their work. OpenAI has rejected the contention that its use of copyrighted data in training products like ChatGPT was illegal, instead arguing that its services create something new and fall under the doctrine of “fair use”. Other companies’ forays into AI-generated search have also resulted in backlash from users and publishers. Google recently launched its own AI-enabled search feature, called AI Overviews, that summarizes content from search results without requiring users to click through to other websites. Although Google touted the feature’s success in an earnings call this week, its rollout was met with criticism from publishers and creators concerned that AI Overviews sap traffic and advertising revenue away from their sites. Another prominent AI-powered search engine, Perplexity, can produce results that are nearly identical to text from the news articles it uses as sources. Multiple publishers have sent Perplexity legal threats and demanded the search engine cease using their content in results.   Related: US financial watchdog urged to investigate NDAs at OpenAI   OpenAI said it was partnering with publishers for SearchGPT, and offering them options about how their content appears within its results, as well as seeking to ensure it promotes trusted sources. The company’s press release included statements from the CEO of the Atlantic and the chief executive of News Corp, both of whom struck reportedly lucrative content deals with OpenAI, praising AI-enabled search as the future of the internet. OpenAI’s possible shake-up to the online search industry comes as Google faces a looming court decision in a landmark antitrust lawsuit brought by US Department of Justice. The suit alleged that the tech giant illegally monopolized the internet search industry through multibillion-dollar deals with companies such as Apple and Samsung to make it the default browser on their devices.\n",
      "Revolut has secured a UK banking licence – with “restrictions” – more than three years after Britain’s most valuable fintech firm lodged its application with regulators. It is a milestone for the company, and will help pave the way for an eventual stock market listing, but it may still be some time before it can hold its customers’ deposits. Tentative approval from the Bank of England means Revolut is in the mobilisation stage, where it will build up its banking operations. The London-headquartered firm has waited years to get to this stage, having lodged its application for a UK banking licence in 2021. The challenge, in part, was convincing regulators that Revolut had addressed a number of accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as reputational concerns, including an over-aggressive corporate culture. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority also reportedly investigated the business in 2016 after a whistleblower claimed it was failing to conduct adequate money-laundering checks or properly flag suspect payments. That investigation was closed in 2017.  Revolut has said it fully complies with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations, and has made efforts to improve its working culture. The consumer group Which? also raised concerns about Revolut and its approach to reimbursing scam victims. A spokesperson said: “Revolut’s banking licence would have some benefits for its customers, for example their money being protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to £85,000. However, the company needs to step up and show how it will improve its approach to stamping out fraud.” Revolut’s founder and chief executive, the former Lehman Brothers trader Nik Storonsky, hit out last year at regulators over the lengthy licensing process, claiming it was “hard to do business in the UK”, where there were high taxes and “an extremely bureaucratic regulator”. He also said he would consider floating the company in the US instead of the UK, in what would be a major blow to the London Stock Exchange. The banking licence is a key step in accelerating Revolut’s growth, because it moves the company on from its current status as an e-money firm that operates as an intermediary between consumers and licensed banks. It will allow Revolut to hold customer deposits, opening the door to new income streams, since it can start funding own-branded loans and mortgages. However, it will also face more stringent regulations as well as being part of the compensation scheme. It is unlikely that a firm would fail to secure a full UK bank licence at this stage, but it is not guaranteed. Most startups use the mobilisation period to address any outstanding issues, such as ensuring they have the appropriate staff, IT systems and governance and accountability checks in place to satisfy officials, and secure their status as a UK bank. This process can “take as little as a few months but cannot continue indefinitely”, according to guidance from the Bank of England, which said it should not take longer than a year. Revolut has not disclosed any of the remaining items on its regulatory checklist.  Approval by UK regulators is likely to persuade regulators in other key countries, such as the US, to follow suit. Storonsky said: “We are incredibly proud to reach this important milestone in the journey of the company and we will ensure we deliver on making Revolut the bank of choice for UK customers.” The announcement comes just weeks after the company reported record annual profits of £438m for 2023, having made a £25m loss a year earlier. Profits were bolstered by higher interest rates and ambitious expansion plans that increased it user base by 12 million customers last year. Revolut gave further hints last month that it was on track for a bumper initial public offering. It said in its annual report that it had enhanced its financial controls in ways expected of “listed companies”. Bosses are reportedly preparing to sell a tranche of employee shares to private investors first in a deal that could bolster its valuation to $40bn (£31bn). Revolut was last valued at $33bn in 2021, making it the most valuable fintech company in the UK.\n",
      "ITV has reported a 17% surge in advertising revenue fuelled by the Euro 2024 tournament, while announcing that it has taken a majority stake in the production company behind shows including Sherlock, The Devil’s Hour and Douglas Is Cancelled. The broadcaster said on Thursday that total ad revenue – including TV and digital – was up 17% year on year for the three months to the end of June, ahead of a forecast rise of 12%. ITV channels carried live coverage of 16 Euro 2024 group stage matches in June, including England v Slovenia, and the national side’s round-of-16 victory over Slovakia. ITV1 also broadcast England’s semi-final victory over the Netherlands on 10 July and shared live coverage of the defeat to Spain in the final with the BBC four days later.   Related: ‘Highly offensive’: police condemn ITV for naming new comedy show Piglets   Carolyn McCall, ITV’s chief executive, said: “There is no question we had a good lift from the Euros in June and in a small part of July.” Overall, ITV ad revenues increased by 10% in the first half of 2024 to £889m. Adjusted profit before tax for the period was up 51% year on year to £178m, on a 3% dip in total revenues to £1.9bn. Its production arm, ITV Studios, reported a 13% fall in revenues for the first half, affected by the writers’ and actors’ strike in the US and the timing of the deliveries of shows to broadcasters. ITV’s share price closed down nearly 4% on Thursday, at 81p, after the company forecast “broadly flat” ad revenues for the three months to the end of September. ITV also announced that its production arm had taken a 51% stake in Hartswood Films, the company behind the Emmy-winning series Sherlock, for an undisclosed sum. Founded in 1979 by the late Beryl Vertue, Hartswood, which is based in London and Cardiff, is the UK’s longest-established scripted TV production company. The management team includes the chief executive, Sue Vertue, Beryl’s daughter, and the creative director, Steven Moffat, co-creator of Sherlock. Hartswood’s other credits include Men Behaving Badly, Coupling and The Time Traveler’s Wife.\n",

      "Anglo American has taken a further £1.2bn ($1.6bn) writedown on its fertiliser mine in North Yorkshire after setting out plans to pause work on the project while it undertakes a sweeping overhaul of the business. Anglo plans to slash its investment in the Woodsmith fertiliser mine – in the North York Moors national park, near Whitby – next year from £1bn annually to £200m, before seeking strategic investors to restart full-scale work on the polyhalite project from 2026. The miner’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, told journalists that its £6bn flagship project could still begin producing polyhalite by the end of the decade if the company’s balance sheet is strengthened and a joint-venture partner is found. It was initially expected to begin production in 2027. The writedown on the Woodsmith project, which was widely expected, led the company to a £544m loss for the first half of the year. Anglo revealed the latest financial blow months after surviving a £38.6bn takeover bid by its larger rival BHP, which has piled pressure on Anglo’s board to shake up the strategy of the 107-year-old company. Wanblad said the 18-month restructuring, which includes plans to sell the diamond business De Beers, was on track to complete by the end of next year. The historic corporate overhaul includes separating its platinum business and selling its coalmines. He said: “We are moving at pace to create a much more agile and structurally profitable mining company focused on our exceptional quality copper and premium iron ore businesses, which both continue to perform very strongly, while maintaining our growth optionality in crop nutrients. “We are committed to completing the key elements of this transformation by the end of 2025, creating a simpler, highly valued mining company with extensive growth options and considerable strategic flexibility.” Anglo is planning to sell De Beers amid falling prices in the global diamond market due to the sluggish global economy and rising competition from lab-created alternatives. The company cut its diamond production on Thursday for the second time this year in an effort to ease oversupply in the market. Wanblad said the company faces a “weak cyclical market” with a recovery expected to be delayed until next year. The market will not stop the company’s plans to sell De Beers, he said. The planned coalmines sale was also cast into doubt at the end of last month by an explosion at its Grosvenor mine in Australia. The company still plans to sell the entire coal business, including the affected mine, by the end of the year. “Most importantly, everyone there is safe. Our process to divest that business is well under way with continued strong interest from a large number of potential new owners,” Wanblad said. The company reported two fatalities from an accident at the company’s Amandelbult platinum mine in South Africa in the first half of the year. Anglo expects to demerge its platinum business, Amplats, next year and is planning a secondary listing in London.\n",
      "A collapse in profits at the carmakers Nissan and worse than expected results at Stellantis, the owner of Citroën, Peugeot and Fiat, have deepened fears of a global downturn in the automotive industry. Shares in Stellantis, which is listed in Milan, plunged on Thursday after it published disappointing earnings, while its French rival Renault also tumbled on the back of the wider concerns despite reporting record profitability. Stellantis, a 14-brand group that also includes Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge and Maserati, said net profit in the first six months of the year had been almost halved to €5.6bn (£4.72bn) for the first half of the year. Its sales fell 14% to €85bn, and were hit by a downturn in Europe and particularly in North America.   Related: ‘High quality, low price and dizzying variety’: how the Chinese switched to electric cars   Also on Thursday, Nissan said its operating profit had collapsed 99% to 995m yen (£5.03m) in the three months to 30 June, with worldwide sales flatlining at just under 800,000. Renault still holds a stake in Nissan, the shares of which plunged more than 10% on Thursday after the company issued a profit warning citing “intense sales competition”, especially in the US. Makoto Uchida, the chief executive of Nissan, blamed the downturn on its performance in the US, saying it was “unable to boost volumes as expected”, which analysts said was partly down to a change over from the old Rogue SUV-type vehicle to a newer model but also to a softening demand. Stellantis pledged to take steps to address problems including output and prices. In a statement Carlos Tavares, its chief executive, said: “The company’s performance in the first half of 2024 fell short of our expectations.” Renault, which earlier this year pledged to bring down the cost of electric vehicles in order to compete with rivals in China, has just signed a deal to build a new low-cost Twingo EV in Slovenia. Results from the industry were published hours after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Britain’s car trade body, said production had slipped 7.6% in both conventional and electric vehicles in the UK in the first half of the year. It said the industry produced more than 416,000 vehicles, about 35,000 fewer than the first half of 2023. Mike Hawes, the body’s chief executive, said it was partly down to the transition to the production of electric vehicles as factories repurpose. He called on the government to halve VAT on new battery electric vehicles and scrap an extra levy on luxury cars costing more than £40,000 that the SMMT says hits about 70% of EV trade. Adding a “carrot” to the market could boost uptake of EVs by 250,000 over three years with experience around the world showing consumers do not respond to “sticks”, Hawes said. The sector is expected to hit bumps in the road ahead as consumers transition from conventional combustion engines to EVs, with affordability and battery anxiety still considered the main barriers to purchase. The Chinese are considered to have a 10-year head start on European and US rivals on the changeover, thanks to an industrial strategy that has enabled the country to build a globally dominant position on the production of lithium hydroxide, one of the most essential and expensive elements in car batteries. The EU recently slapped provisional tariffs on Chinese imports, with Brussels determined to protect the bloc’s auto industry, arguing they had benefited from state subsidies and a range of supports ranging from free land for factories to financial support for shipping to European ports.

      "Unilever, the owner of Marmite, Dove and Ben & Jerry’s, has defended price rises continuing despite a better-than-expected 17% increase in profits. Shares in the London-based company rose 6% on Thursday morning as Unilever said its profit margins had gone up 2.5 points to 19.6% in first half of the year – well ahead of analyst expectations – as prices rose 1.6%. Underlying operating profit increased 17.1% year-on-year to €6.1bn (£5.14bn) for the period to the end of June. The company said its profit margins had been helped by “carry-over pricing from a period of higher inflation”, as well as efficiency benefits from selling more products and more premium brands. Shares in the London-based company went up 6% on Thursday morning as Unilever said its profit margins had risen 2.5 points to 19.6% in first half of the year – well ahead of analyst expectations – as prices rose 1.6%. Hein Schumacher, the chief executive of Unilever, said: “Over the last year we did not pass on all of the inflationary impact to consumers.” The strong profits came despite a slowdown in the US beauty market and disappointing sales in south-east Asia, where Unilever said trade had been partly hit by a consumer boycott of western brands owing to events in Gaza. The amount of ice-cream sold fell by 1% amid unseasonable weather in Europe and “challenging market dynamics” in China, where Cornetto sales were down. Unilever said it was “on track” to demerge its ice-cream business, which includes Magnum and Wall’s, by the end of 2025. The figures were in contrast to a difficult half-year for its rival Nestlé, which warned sales growth for the next six months would now be a quarter less than hoped for, at 3%. The owner of KitKat, Purina cat food and Nescafé coffee reported pet food, ice-cream and nutrition sales had lagged behind expectations as analysts said the group had encountered soft demand in China and tough price competition elsewhere. Analysts at Jefferies suggested there were “signs of slashed pricing” and concerns about “the strength of brands in this new environment” as cost of living pressure weighed on households, prompting them to consider supermarket own-label alternatives to well-known brands. Schumacher said Unilever expected profit margins to be at least 18% in the second half of the year as prices across the grocery industry would continue to increase by between 2% and 3% into next year. Fernando Fernandez, the finance director of Unilever, said that price rises were being underpinned by wage inflation, which “remains significant” and that not all this extra cost would be passed to consumers as the company wanted to ensure brand competitiveness. Schumacher said the group had seen increasing promotional activity in Europe and deflation in some developing markets such as India, but promotions remained steady in North America. Unilever continues to trade in Russia, attracting controversy as many western brands have pulled out since the invasion of Ukraine. Schumacher said the company had “localised operations” in Russia and its goal was to “minimise economic contribution” to the state. “This is a very tough situation and very much on my mind. We continue to monitor operations there very closely,” he added.\n",
      "Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a tumble on Thursday as jitters over the future artificial intelligence-driven growth of major tech companies sparked a global sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the day down 0.7%, having been hit by a near 4% decline in the Dutch chipmaker ASML, a 7% drop in Germany’s Infineon Technologies, and a 13.7% fall in Switzerland’s semiconductor company STMicroelectronics. The rout began in the US overnight, where the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 3.6% on Wednesday, marking its biggest single-day decline since 2022. About $1tn (£776bn) was knocked off the value of the Nasdaq 100, which covers the most valuable firms on the index.   Related: Why have US shares, gold and the dollar been soaring?   The main losers were AI-related companies, including Nvidia, Tesla and the Google-owner Alphabet, whose shares have soared in recent months. Investors have poured money into the sector, to ensure they did not miss out on a potential tech boom in artificial intelligence. The fall has raised concerns about whether excitement over major tech stocks, known as the magnificent seven, has been overblown. Nvidia fell 7%, Alphabet fell 5%, Microsoft dropped 3.5% and Apple lost 3%. Other magnificent seven stocks also fell, including Facebook owner Meta, which dropped 5.6%. Tesla had its worst decline since 2020, dropping 12%. The company’s boss, Elon Musk, had reported a 45% fall in profits and pushed back plans to unveil self-driving robotaxis from August to October, igniting scepticism among investors. Musk has been trying to drum up interest in plans for the robot taxis, artificial intelligence and “genuinely useful” humanoid robots, as demand for Tesla’s electric cars has cooled. The stock market losses later spread to Asia, where tech-related firms continued their decline. That included Samsung, which fell 2%, Sony, which fell 5%, and tech investor SoftBank, which fell 9.4%. Japan’s Nikkei finished the session down 3%. However, the AJ Bell investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said the sell-off may be a “necessary correction”. He added: “It is worth putting last night’s weakness into perspective, given indices were recently trading at record highs and there were big moves in some enormous companies. “Whether this is a necessary correction to remove some froth from the market or something more dramatic will depend on forthcoming earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon next week, as well as AI-star Nvidia at the end of August.” Early trading on Wall Street was more subdued on Thursday, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices slightly up, as GDP data showing that the US economy grew faster than expected in the three months to the end of June.\n",
      "Fewer borrowers are likely to default on their loans and mortgages, Lloyds has said, as the banking group upped its forecasts for the UK economy. In fresh estimates released as part of its second-quarter results, Lloyds said it expected the economy to grow 0.8% in 2024 – double the rate of growth it expected back in April, when it predicted a 0.4% rise. Improving economic conditions are good news for Lloyds customers, who the bank says are less likely to fall behind on costly loan and mortgage payments. Lloyds, which is the UK’s largest mortgage lender and owns the Halifax brand, set aside just £44m for bad debts and defaults in the second quarter. That is down 89% from the £419m put aside during the same period last year when there were serious concerns over whether mortgage borrowers, already squeezed by the cost of living crisis, could afford higher interest rates. “We’ve seen both across individuals and small businesses, positive economic developments,” the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said on Thursday. “There is a real resilience we’re seeing in the first half [of the year] and it’s linked to now three-quarters … of real wage growth. Many businesses’ cashflows are also strengthening.” The smaller provision for defaults helped offset a 9% drop in Lloyds’ net interest income, which is an important measure of profitability, and accounts for the difference between what a bank makes on loan charges versus what is paid out to savers. The drop came amid tougher competition, with Lloyds having to charge less for loans and pay out more to interest-seeking savers, to attract and maintain customers. Overall, pre-tax profit rose 5% in the three months to the end of June, to £1.7bn. Nunn suggested UK GDP and Lloyds’ finances could improve further if the Labour government’s growth plans succeeded. “Unlocking growth is not easy … And we’ve been working closely [with the government] to say what are the things that make a difference,” the chief executive said. “If we really do get some of the big infrastructure investments, some of the investments in our core sectors like energy; if we get confidence in [small and medium-sized enterprises] growing again; and then we get consumers who have confidence to spend, save and invest for the future; if those things happen, that’s when we thrive.”\n",
      "British Gas profits have begun to ease from record high levels last year as the market shows signs of “normalising” after the energy crisis. The UK’s biggest energy supplier reported operating profits of £159m for the first half of the year, down significantly from the same months last year when it reported its highest-ever first-half profits of almost £1bn. British Gas made record high profits of £969m a year earlier after the energy watchdog, Ofgem, let it claw back more money from household bills to recoup the costs of supplying its 10 million customers during the energy crisis. The regulator’s decision handed British Gas a £500m boost but after the one-off windfall the supplier’s profits have fallen back in line with more typical earnings. “A large portion of British Gas Energy’s profit in 2023 was a direct result of these cost recovery allowances. Today’s number represents the transition to a more normalising energy landscape,” the company said on Thursday. The cooling of British Gas profits led to lower earnings for its parent company, Centrica. The FTSE 100 giant reported earnings £1.1bn for the first half of the year compared with £2.3bn in the first half of last year. Centrica’s chief executive, Chris O’Shea, said the company had performed in line with expectations in the first half of 2024, “against the backdrop of more normalised market conditions”, and signalled that it would start to compete for new customers. He said investments in the company’s data capabilities, product innovation and customer service had driven “marked improvements in customer satisfaction” that would allow it to “continue shifting the focus to growing customer numbers”. British Gas had 7.48 million household customers at the end of the first half of this year, compared with 7.53 million at the same point last year. Its total customer base, including business customers, was stable at 10.2m compared with 10.26 million last year.\n",

      "Undercover filming by the Guardian suggests multimillionaire UK residents are being pitched offshore products said to legally protect their fortunes from inheritance tax (IHT) and capital gains tax (CGT).\n",
      "At a private event held a week before the general election, the international accounting brand Baker Tilly told advisers to the ultra-wealthy how they could use offshore pension schemes to shield their clients’ fortunes from tens of millions of pounds of inheritance taxes.\n",
      "One promoter told how his client had placed £30m into a pension scheme to protect it from inheritance taxes.\n",
      "He told an undercover reporter at the exclusive event in the City of London that the government would not legislate to close the schemes down as ministers have “bigger fish to fry”.\n",
      "While the schemes are legal, critics argue tax avoidance is immoral and deprives the public purse of hundreds of millions of pounds that could fund vital services.\n",
      "Labour has promised to renew the focus on tax avoidance by “the wealthy” to “ensure everyone pays their fair share” as it grapples with threadbare public finances and growing demands to settle long-running disputes over public sector pay and benefits. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is due to give more detail about the state of the public finances next week, a move expected to pave the way for tax rises.\n",
      "The Guardian revealed in June that Labour was drafting ways to raise money through extra wealth taxes after the election, with changes to CGT and IHT under consideration – measures that could raise up to £10bn. Labour has also said it will clamp down on the “non-domicile” regime, which allows people to live in the UK and not pay tax on their overseas income.\n",
      "At the event run by a company called the Private Client Dining Club, held days before the general election, advisers to the super-rich were told how to exploit a little-known offshore tax loophole.\n",
      "Stuart Clifford, a principal at Baker Tilly Isle of Man, explained to an undercover reporter: “My last one I did of these – £30m … [The client] said … ‘That’s my kids’ money. So let’s protect it from IHT today.’ [The] day he got it – £30m [went] into [the offshore product]. He’s not doing anything funky. He’s not paying a lot for it, that’s just going through investment managers and what have you.”\n",
      "Inheritance tax is typically charged at a rate of 40% above a £325,000 threshold for fortunes given away to a non-spouse or non-civil partner – implying almost £12m of taxes saved by the Baker Tilly client’s children.\n",
      "Baker Tilly Isle of Man declined to reveal the value of assets it had helped clients place into these schemes during the past five years, but said “the remarks attributed to us have been taken out of context from the much wider discussions surrounding retirement planning”.\n",
      "The product the company was promoting at the event is a little-known offshore retirement plan called a qualifying non-UK pension scheme (QNUPS), which is available to UK residents.\n",
      "The scheme relies on current tax rules that exempt pension assets from certain taxes. Clifford suggested offshore pensions could be used by rich individuals to avoid future taxes on property investments.\n",
      "“The amount of people who have got property where they are potentially one day sitting on a big capital gains liability, a big inheritance tax liability,” he said.\n",
      "A week before the election, Clifford predicted that neither Labour nor the Conservatives would change the law to stop rich individuals using QNUPS as a method of avoiding IHT, as specific rules would need altering.\n",
      "“[It is] UK law, which is why I say I don’t care what the red and blue team do to IHT [after the election],” he added. “It isn’t going to change the QNUPS regulations because [QNUPS have] an exemption from whatever [the IHT rule] looks like. It’s that simple.”\n",
      "Claire Aston, the director of the campaign group TaxWatch, said: “For a well-known accountancy firm such as Baker Tilly to be caught on camera saying that the government won’t be looking at this as they have ‘bigger fish to fry’ is clear evidence that they consider this to have nothing to do with retirement pensions – but is an avoidance scheme for UK inheritance and capital gains tax.\n",
      "“Given the new Labour government’s commitment to clamp down on tax avoidance, this looks like a great place to start. The law needs to change to stop UK resident taxpayers shuffling valuable assets offshore for the sole purpose of saving tax”.\n",
      "Pension schemes have long been exempt from IHT in the UK. However, QNUPS – which are sold by a range of different companies that typically focus their sales pitches on the tax savings – have added advantages to wealthy investors. Those benefits include “no limit on the size of your contribution”, as well as the schemes allowing individuals to invest “a much broader range of asset classes than traditional pensions [including] property, stocks, shares and art/antiques”.\n",
      "Clifford added that using QNUPS to avoid capital gains taxes due on property investments was “massive” – and that the company insisted any client taking up the pension product took “tax advice”.\n",
      "He said: “As soon as it’s in [the QNUPS] – bang – that’s the protection. It’s a statutory exemption. It’s not a loophole. It’s not a grey area. It’s a statutory exemption.”\n",
      "Inheritance tax raises about £7.5bn a year for the exchequer but the levy is considered relatively simple to avoid. \n",
      "A paper called Reforming Inheritance Tax, which was published in September 2023 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, stated: “There are several problems with the current design of inheritance taxation … the total exemption of pension pots from inheritance tax, open up channels to avoid the tax and are consequently costly and inequitable.”\n",
      "There have been a series of stories over the past week hinting that the new Labour government is considering introducing changes to the way the exchequer collects inheritance and capital gains taxes. These include suggestions that the chancellor is coming under pressure to launch a £2bn inheritance tax raid on pension pots to help fund public spending pledges.\n",
      "A spokesperson for Baker Tilly Isle of Man said: “QNUPS, the regulations for which were introduced by HMRC in 2010, is just one of several well-established retirement solutions that Baker Tilly Isle of Man offer as a pension provider to UK and overseas citizens and is at all times administered in accordance with the required laws and regulations in place in the UK. For a pension scheme to be recognised as a QNUPS it must meet strict HMRC guidelines.\n",
      "“Any individual wishing to register for QNUPS is expected to obtain independent tax advice (UK or otherwise as appropriate to their circumstances) as evidence of their suitability to be accepted as a member.\n",

      "While Kamala Harris has restored some hope for Democrats in November, the likelihood of a Trump presidency still remains very strong. And if that happens, Australia may find itself more damaged than any other major country. Seven years ago during Trump’s first term, Rabobank economist Michael Every gave a presentation at a conference in Canberra that freaked the audience out. He investigated how bad things could get if Trump began a serious trade war. The worst case did not eventuate, but like a company’s bad second product, a second Trump presidency looks likely to send us down a dark path that we had avoided in his first attempt. Before we get to the economy, we should note some other important issues. Last Sunday was the hottest day on record for the planet. It came off the back of June being the hottest June on record – making it 13 months in a row of records being set:    If the graph does not display click here So quickly is the world warming that what used to be considered hot now looks positively chilly:    If the graph does not display click here The 12 months to June 2010 were a record 1C above the 1880-1909 average – it hasn’t been that cool now for nearly a decade. A Trump presidency would almost certainly ensure this keeps rising. During his deranged Republican National Convention speech, one of his biggest cheers came when he used the old line of “drill, baby, drill” (a line the Albanese government agrees with, given it keeps opening up new gas fields). So forget emissions reductions or global agreements while he is in power. Then of course we have defence.   Related: Australian workers’ living standards have been destroyed – and there is little good news ahead | Greg Jericho   The Albanese government for no logical reason has strapped itself into Scott Morrison’s $368bn suicide vest, also known as Aukus. Spending that much money to annoy our non-English speaking neighbours and thus make Australia less safe while we wait for nuclear submarines that will never arrive (much like Dutton’s nuclear power plants) is bad enough. Add in a Trump foreign policy, and Anthony Albanese should be telling the defence minister right now to get us out of this horror show. Of course, while things might get bad for Australia, given Trump has said he will act as a dictator on day one, will probably approve an abortion ban and be empowered by the supreme court to undertake whatever illegal actions he feels like, we do need to keep some perspective for how bad things will be for those in America itself.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  However, a Trump presidency would have a pretty dire economic impact on Australia. The direct hit would be a 10% tariff on all exports to the US. Trump’s love of tariffs seems linked to his former economic adviser Peter Navarro’s belief that imports make the economy smaller. While imports do technically reduce GDP, that’s only done to avoid double counting. Every import we buy is something we consume and so if we didn’t subtract imports from GDP we would count things twice, first as an import and then as a consumption item (or investment if they are capital goods). But Trump has got it into his brain that reducing imports makes the economy stronger, thus reducing imports via a tariff would make America richer – even though everyone would instantaneously have to pay 10% more for every imported good. This of course would hurt all nations that export to the US, but luckily, we are not all that reliant on the US as an export destination any more:    If the graph does not display click here As we all know, most of our exports go to China. But this is where things start to get dicey for us. Because while Trump wants to put a 10% tariff on all imports, he wants a tariff of 60% for those from China. That would be pretty destructive to a Chinese economy that is already struggling. China would no doubt respond in kind, and most other nations would probably get in on the act. At this point, Michael Every’s nightmare scenario of a trade war (and possible real war) would start to play out. But even if the situation remains purely economic rather than military, a report from the OECD in May found that Australia’s economy would be among the ones to suffer the most. The report found that a 10% reduction of trade across all sectors between the OECD and the major non-OECD countries (which include China and India) would see Australia’s GDP fall by 1.2%. That was second-worst behind South Korea. Australia would suffer worse than any other nation in mining, agriculture, and metals and metal products, and third-worst for oil and gas extraction – only behind Russia and Brazil:    If the graph does not display click here So, not good. And remember this estimate of a 1.2% drop in GDP comes when our economy is already shrinking when we exclude population growth. It also comes at a time when the ANZ has suggested unemployment could rise above 5% by the end of next year. Earlier this year I noted that unemployment was rising at a rate that was close to triggering what is known as the “Sahm rule” of recessions. In March and April things steadied a bit, but the June 4.1% unemployment rate puts us on the brink of breaking the barrier that US economist Claudia Sahm argues is consistent with recessions: a 0.5 percentage point rise in unemployment over 12 months:    If the graph does not display click here So no, a Trump presidency would not be good for Australia should he carry through with his tariff plan. A recession gets much more likely. Unfortunately, bad as that would be, given the dire impact of climate change and the risks that a breakdown in America’s democratic institutions would pose for our own security, the worst news is a recession might be the least of our problems.

      "Disappointing figures from the luxury goods conglomerates LVMH and Kering as shoppers reined in spending on handbags, designer clothing and champagne have hit the value of firms in the sector around the world amid fears of ongoing weak demand. Shares in LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany, slid nearly 5% as it revealed that sales in the key Asian markets, excluding Japan, were down 14% in the three months to June amid weak demand for Cognac in China and slowdowns in demand for fashion, watches, leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics. Analysts said lower-priced goods, including some handbags, were performing worse than higher priced items such as garments. Shares in Kering were down more than 4% as group revenues fell 11% in the first half of the year to €9bn, led by an 18% slump at Gucci. Group underlying operating profit slumped 42% to €1.6bn with Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent all down significantly. The company warned profits could be down 30% in the second half of the year compared with the same period last year amid “uncertainties weighing on the evolution of demand from luxury consumers in the coming months”. François-Henri Pinault, the chair and chief executive of Kering, said: “In a challenging market environment, which adds pressure on our top line and profitability, we are working assiduously to create the conditions for a return to growth.” Bag maker Hermès International, the British brand Burberry, Coach owner Tapestry Inc, Richemont and Brunello Cucinelli all saw their value slip on stock markets amid fears of an ongoing slump in luxury goods sales. Luxury goods firms have seen demand tail off, especially for cheaper products bought by aspirational shoppers, as higher interest rates have brought the cost of living squeeze to the middle classes. LVMH reported a 1% rise in underlying sales to €20.98bn in the three months to June, a third of the level expected by City analysts and a slowdown from the 3% reported in the first quarter. Group profits from recurring operations fell 8% to €10.7bn in the half year. Bernard Arnault, the chair and chief executive of LVMH, said: “The results for the first half of the year reflect LVMH’s remarkable resilience, backed by the strength of its maisons and the responsiveness of its teams in a climate of economic and geopolitical uncertainty.” LVMH said it has suffered from the “substantial negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations” while the slowdown in China had been offset by “substantial growth” in Japan boosted by Chinese tourists. Wine and spirits sales fell 5% in the quarter, although that was a recovery from the 12% drop in the prior three months. Profits for the division were down by a quarter in the half year as the company said champagne sales had fallen in Europe and the US as demand returned to normal after a Covid lockdown boom. Underlying sales of cognac were down 10% amid “weak demand” in China. Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: “LVMH’s sales in the second quarter were lacklustre, with 1% constant-currency growth, though better than weaker peers, like Burberry and Swatch, and in line with Richemont.” She added that Chinese consumption shifted to Japan to “take advantage of currency weakness” and overall sales to Chinese consumers globally were up by more than 8% in the first half. Watches and jewellery were hit hard, with sales down 4% in the quarter compared with a 2% drop in the prior three months and profits were down by 19% in the half year. Sokolova said this was down to a poor performance at Tiffany which was “affected by listless bridal demand and sluggish aspirational consumer demand in the US, and sales decline among Chinese consumers”. There was also a slowdown in growth at the group’s retail arm as poor sales at the DFS duty free airport retailer offset strong growth at Sephora, while perfumes and cosmetics sales rose just 4% in the second quarter compared with growth of 7% in the prior three months.\n",

The 111-year-old company, best known as the maker of cars in the James Bond spy film series, nearly went bust for an eighth time in 2020 but was saved by Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire fashion mogul. Since then, Stroll has struggled to turn the company around, first by trying to restore an air of exclusivity to the brand by reducing the number of cars held by dealers and sponsoring a Formula One race team, and then by releasing new models. It has launched a new Vantage sports car and the DBX 707, an update of the sports utility vehicle that has played a significant role in increased sales. Alongside its DB12 and Vanquish sports car models, it means the carmaker has an all-new lineup, with updated infotainment systems that addressed some criticism of previous models. Stroll said the launch of the sports cars and the SUV was a “pivotal moment” for the company after years of trying to turn it around. The former Bentley boss Adrian Hallmark will take over as chief executive under Stroll, who is chair, in September. Stroll said Aston Martin would start generating cash later this year, as the benefits of heavy investment finally bore fruit. “We have a big third and fourth quarter coming up,” he added. Aston Martin will still have big investments ahead, most notably in the shift to electric cars. None of the models it has made so far are electric, although it plans to release a plug-in hybrid version Valhalla super car in 2026, a year later than initially planned. There have been questions over whether the Labour government will reinstate the ban on new petrol and diesel cars in the UK in 2030, after the Conservative former prime minister Rishi Sunak delayed it until 2035. Labour committed to putting it back to 2030 in its manifesto. However, Aston Martin’s chief financial officer, Doug Lafferty, said the company hoped to benefit from allowances for smaller manufacturers to continue to sell cars up to 2035. He told reporters: “The current legislation allows for a derogation for small volume manufacturers, and we don’t see any deviation from that.” Aston Martin was not alone in reporting a decline in the first half. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the number of new cars leaving UK factories fell by 7.6% to 416,074 between January and June. But it said the drop was expected, due to carmakers overhauling their production lines to make electrified models.\n",
      "Thames Water has breached its licence to supply water to nearly 16 million people after some of its debt was downgraded to junk status. The regulator Ofwat could now fine Thames, the country’s largest water monopoly, up to 10% of its annual turnover, equating to hundreds of millions of pounds. However, since the company is already teetering close to temporary renationalisation, Ofwat is likely to hold off on any immediate large fines. Urgent talks are being held between Thames and Ofwat to try to find a way to turn the company’s management and finances around, with expectations that these must conclude, for better or worse, next month, the Guardian understands. Thames is labouring under a £15.2bn debt mountain and has been brought to its knees after billions of pounds in dividends were extracted by its former owners, including the Australian bank Macquarie. If the talks fail, it is unlikely Thames will be able to escape being pulled on to the UK government’s balance sheet via a special administration regime, although Thames said it was still seeking fresh investment. The company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, has said it has enough money to continue its operations until May next year. It said in response to the downgrade that it “continues to work with Ofwat” on its “financial resilience”. For its customers and workers it was “business as usual”, it said. The downgrade came from Moody’s, one of three big credit ratings companies that categorise debt according to the perceived risk of it not being repaid. A separate downgrade is expected from another ratings company, S&P, in the coming weeks. Thames had signalled earlier in the year that a downgrade might be imminent and would put it in breach of its licence obligations. A key bond at Thames Water Utilities Finance plc – within the ringfenced part of Thames’s complex corporate structure that is overseen by Ofwat – was cut to a ranking of Ba1. This is one notch into Moody’s definition of junk territory, also termed non-investment grade. Water suppliers’ operating licences were changed in 2020 to require them to keep their debt rated as so-called investment grade. The move was meant to ensure they remained attractive to long-term, patient investors such as pension funds, which are often restricted from investing in riskier debt with lower ratings, known as junk. Thames will need an additional £2.5bn from investors to fulfil its business plan. Ofwat said in a draft decision in July that Thames could increase bills by £99 to £535 a year over the next five years, £92 less than the rise it sought. Moody’s cited Thames’ “weakening liquidity position” in its explanation for the downgrade and said “existing or future equity investors may view the proposed risk and return profile as not sufficiently attractive” for such a large injection of new cash. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “This downgrade reinforces our position that a comprehensive financial and operational turnaround in Thames’ operations is essential.” Water companies in England and Wales operate under a 25-year rolling licence. These can only be revoked under certain conditions, including entering the special administration regime.\n",
      "It’s the end of an era as Telstra and Optus prepare to shut down 3G – a mobile network that dates back to the early days of the iPhone – at the end of August. While there are few phones in the market that will be affected, business groups are worried that alarms, CCTV and other products reliant on 3G will be, and that Australian businesses might not realise until it’s too late. Here’s what you need to know. What is the 3G shutdown? Mobile network providers Telstra, Optus and TPG operate – or have until recently operated – three generations of mobile networks: 3G, 4G and 5G.   Related: Shutdown of 3G networks a ‘health and safety issue’ for some regional Australians    Most new mobile phones will connect to 4G or 5G, but fall back to 3G when those networks are unavailable – particularly in regional and remote parts of Australia. Plus, a lot of non-handset devices – such as ATMs, CCTV, Eftpos, fridges, vending machines, medical alert systems and more – have used the 3G networks to connect to the internet and stay online. Why is 3G being shut down? The network operators say they’re shutting down the network, as with 2G, to free up the radio spectrum for 5G networks. Using the spectrum for 5G – which allows more users at higher speeds – will allow them to keep up with the increasing demand for data on mobile networks, which Telstra says grows by 30% every year. James Chisholm, the infrastructure department’s deputy secretary in communications, told a parliamentary inquiry that 3G would not be able to withstand the demand for the “greater use of video technology and streaming on devices” and “as technology advances and consumers expect more and more services – on their phones, for example”.  When are the networks shutting down? TPG, the parent company of Vodafone, has already shut down its 3G network, calling time at the end of 2023. Optus and Telstra are slated to shut down their networks on 31 August but Telstra has said it will keep small pockets of 3G active until there is equivalent 4G coverage in those areas.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Will it mean worse mobile coverage? Probably not. There is concern in regional and remote parts of Australia, but the telcos say they’re planning the same or better 4G coverage by the time 3G is switched off. Provided the devices are 4G-compatible, they say customers shouldn’t even notice. TPG told the inquiry that it received very low levels of customer complaints after it switched 3G off. How many handsets currently won’t work on 4G? A major concern for the shutdown – and the reason Telstra delayed its shutdown from June to August – is that more than 740,000 4G handsets at the start of this year were not compatible to make calls on 4G – they used 3G. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said this week that this number had been reduced to about 100,000. Telstra said about 33,000 handsets on its network were 3G-only. TPG said it had some 228 3G-only devices – even though it doesn’t operate 3G any more – and another 8,000 or so 4G devices unable to make calls on 4G. Optus did not provide its breakdown figure to the hearing. People who aren’t sure if their device is affected by the 3G shutdown can text the number 3 to 3498 to check. What if I can’t afford a new phone? The telcos say that they’ve been in contact with customers affected by the shutdown with a range of offers for a compatible phone, with thousands of those enduring hardship able to get a phone for free. What about other devices? While the focus of the messaging about the shutdown has concerned people’s mobile phones, there are many other devices that connect to the internet via 3G. Telstra says it has 399,000 internet-of-things devices – such as water meters, electricity meters and more – that are not 4G-capable, as well as 63,000 early-version smartwatches and 45,000 wireless broadband devices or tablets. Optus says it has about 100,000 devices predominantly used by small and large businesses, including payment terminals, monitoring and telemetry devices. TPG says it has more than 13,000 non-handset devices on its network that aren’t 4G-compatible. What will happen with those devices? The telcos say they’ve been attempting to work with the businesses that supply those products to make sure they’re being replaced or upgraded before the deadline. But business groups and other organisations that have relied on 3G devices have raised concerns that most won’t be aware the switch-off is happening or what devices might be connected. “A fridge isn’t going to complain,” the Royal Flying Doctor Service’s chief information officer, Ryan Klose, told the parliamentary inquiry. He said the service was spending more than $200,000 replacing devices and relying on Starlink’s low-Earth orbit satellite service as a 3G alternative in regional and remote areas. Will there be a 3G network outage apocalypse in September? It could spell chaos. The small business and family enterprise ombudsman, Bruce Billson, told the inquiry the first time many businesses may learn their device connects via 3G is when it stops working. Further the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Jodie Trembath warned the parliamentary inquiry that crucial services, such as warning, alarm and pump systems, might not be switched over before the cut-off. The department said it had spent the past year engaging with the affected sectors, such as banking, and their peak bodies to amplify the message about the upcoming shutdown. It continued that the Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac have said there are less than 3,000 Eftpos machines left across Australia using 3G and they’re working to replace them all. The medical alarm industry was also “well advanced” in switching over customers to 4G, the department added. Can the government force the telcos not to shut down 3G? The communications minister has the option to consider regulatory intervention in the public interest, including to protect public safety, the department said. And Rowland could also, hypothetically, delay the shutdown, Chisholm said. A previous minister, Helen Coonan, used the power to delay the shutdown of the CDMA network to transition to 2G. Chisholm told the inquiry the focus was on ensuring that the transition away from 3G happened when the identified issueshad been adequately addressed.\n",

      "  3.17pm BST  Thames Water says it is working with regulator as analysts eye nationalisation  Could the Moody’s downgrade be the signal for Thames Water to enter a special administration regime – a form of temporary nationalisation for utilities?  That is the message from some analysts. Reuters reported that Satish Pulle, credit analyst at Seaport Global, said:  Almost certainly it will mean special administration for the company.  But Thames Water said it is “business as usual”, and that it is working with the regulator on how to refinance the regulated company, Thames Water Utilities Limited. A spokespeson said:  TWUL alerted Ofwat to the possibility of potential credit rating downgrades in April 2024 and continues to work with Ofwat to maintain the ongoing financial resilience of the business. Management is engaging with investors and its creditors and remains committed to seeking new equity funding and exploring all options to extend its liquidity runway. Increasing our financial resilience and securing an investible PR24 determination is a critical priority for the business.

Ofwat requires water companies to be rated as “investment grade” by two separate agencies, or else face greater oversight. S&P, a rival to Moody’s, said this month that Thames Water could lose its investment-grade BBB- rating, because it “might not be able to maintain adequate liquidity”. (For a comparison of the arcane ratings systems used by the big three rating agencies, Wikipedia has a very handy table.) Moody’s also said it has a negative outlook on Thames Water’s rating. There are two reasons given for this:  (1) the final determination expected later this year would deter existing or new shareholders from providing sufficient additional equity during the next regulatory period to allow the company to deliver its investment programme; (2) in the absence of a pathway to future equity support, existing lenders may be reluctant to provide the company with the required flexibility to improve its immediate liquidity runway by raising new debt.      2.31pm BST   Water regulator Ofwat also has “challenging targets for operational performance” that could force Thames Water to pay £80m to £90m a year in penalities, Moody’s said. Ominously, Moody’s said:  Main areas of penalties are linked to pollution events and sewer flooding.  And then there are likely another £20m in annual penalties for “weak service provision”.     2.27pm BST   Here are the reasons Moody’s has cited for its debt rating downgrade of Thames Water. Thames Water has said it can keep going until May without raising more funding. Moody’s believes that Thames Water could extend its life a few more months until the July to September quarter by cutting investment or costs, but then it would be in trouble.  So what to do? The company that supplies water to London and the Thames Valley in south east England, so it should be attractive to investors. But it needs to invest heavily to meet regulatory requirements. It will either have to raise new equity, debt or use “liability management” (which could, for instance, involve asking for delays on repayments). But Thames already has too much debt, which will mean existing creditors will have control over terms of new borrowing. Moody’s said they probably will not allow Thames to borrow more unless it finds new investment. Yet who would invest in a company that needs to spend £2.5bn just to get to where regulators think it should be?     2.05pm BST  Thames Water debt judged as \"junk\" by Moody's  Thames Water has had its credit rating downgraded to “junk” status by the Moody’s agency, in a move that will add to pressure on the English water company’s finances. Moody’s said the company may struggle to find new investment after the regulator, Ofwat, imposed restrictions on the company this month. It downgraded the rating from Baa3 to Ba2. Baa3 is the last tier of Moody’s ratings that counts as “investment grade”, a category that makes it easier to access funding. Ba2 is the second rating in “junk” status. Thames Water’s previous owners loaded up on debt and extracted huge dividends. That has left the company struggling to fund the £2.5bn in investment it has said it needs to keep running adequately – and to start to address public disgust over sewage in British waterways. Moody’s said:  We see elevated risk that existing or future equity investors may view the proposed risk and return profile as not sufficiently attractive to provide the sizeable equity requirement of at least GBP2.5 billion under Thames Water’s current business plan and likely more in the context of the proposed determination.      1.21pm BST  CrowdStrike pledges to make changes after Windows meltdown disaster  The company whose faulty software caused the global meltdown in many Windows computers has said it will make changes to the way it operates. CrowdStrike said it would make future updates on a “staggered deployment strategy”, meaning that the cybersecurity company will roll them out gradually rather than to every computer at once, in an update on Wednesday. It will also monitor the effects of updates more closely, and allow customers to chose when updates are installed. The company provides businesses with protection against viruses and other malware, but it became a household name after an update to its virus definitions ended up making millions of computers unusable.

Profits of £1.1bn from the crown estate – a percentage of which funds the monarchy – mean the sovereign grant, which supports the official duties of the royal family, will rise from £86m in 2024-25 to £132m in 2025-26, write the Guardian’s Caroline Davies and David Pegg. The monarchy currently receives 12% of the crown estate profits to fund its work as well as to fund the 10-year, £369m renovation of Buckingham Palace. Royal aides said the increase will be used to complete the palace reservicing programme by 2027. The sovereign grant will be reviewed in 2026-27 to reassess the amount handed over to the palace and ensure it is an “appropriate level”. Royal accounts also show that the Prince of Wales received £23.6m income from the Duchy of Cornwall in his first full year after inheriting the land and property owning estate from his father.

Sales rose by 1% year-on-year to €21bn, below the €21.6bn consensus expectation. That disappointed analysts, and prompted a drop in fashion share prices across Europe. Reuters reported:  The earnings miss weighed on other luxury stocks, with Hermes down around 2% and Kering off 3%.

Shoplifting offences rose by 30% to 443,995 offences compared with 342,428 in the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics’ latest crime numbers. The British Retail Consortium, a lobby group, estimates that shoplifting costs UK businesses £3.3bn. It is awaiting details of a pledge by the Labour government to bring in stronger measures to tackle shoplifting in its Crime and Policing Bill. Shoplifting had already reached its highest since records began in 2004, and has now risen further. Explanations for the increase differ, but some possible answers are thought to include the cost of living crisis and increasing targeting by organised gangs. (Those two forces may be related.)   Related: Did you pay for that? What is driving the massive rise in shoplifting?       11.42am BST   Doug Lafferty, Aston Martin’s chief financial officer, said that the company will seek to make petrol engine cars until 2035. There have been questions over whether the new Labour government will reinstate the ban on new petrol and diesel cars in the UK in 2030, after former prime minister Rishi Sunak delayed it until 2035. Labour committed to putting it back to 2030 in its manifesto. However, Lafferty said the company hopes to benefit from allowances for smaller manufacturers to continue to sell cars up to 2035. He told reporters:  The current legislation allows for a derogation for small volume manufacturers, and we don’t see any deviation from that.  Lafferty also said the UK government should support international trade, but did not express a view on whether Labour should consider introducing tariffs on Chinese cars. The EU and the US have brought in tariffs of up to 38.5% and 100% respectively in protectionist moves. That has raised some concerns that trade – particularly of electric vehicles – could be diverted to the UK, flooding the market. On the other hand, it the UK did respond it could draw retaliation by China, potentially harming exports. Aston Martin sells about 7% of exports to mainland China, but it already pays tariffs of 15%, which are added to list prices. Lafferty said:  We export a lot of our products and everything they can do to support international trade would be positive. If we need to deal with it, we’ll deal with it, but they [tariffs] already exist today.      11.33am BST  Aston Martin shares rise as it expects strong second half despite big loss  Aston Martin has reported a drop in sales and increased losses for the first half of 2024, but the luxury carmaker said it expects a strong second half as new cars go on sale. The FTSE 250 company’s share price rose 9% on Wednesday as it beat analyst expectations and promised an “exciting” second half. Aston Martin’s first half losses rose by 52% to £2167m, while the number of cars sold to dealers fell by a third to 2,000. Yet it promised a pick-up in sales in the next six months. The sportscar maker is launching its new Vantage sportscar and the DBX 707, an update of the sports utility vehicle that has played a key role in increased sales. Alongside its DB12 and Vanquish models, it means the carmaker has an all-new line-up. Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire fashion mogul who took over Aston Martin in early 2020, said he believes the company now has “the newest and the strongest portfolio in the ultra-luxury segment”. He said the launch of the new sportscars – alongside the top-selling SUV – was the “pivotal moment” for the company after years of trying to turn it around. Former Bentley boss Adrian Hallmark will take over as chief executive under Stroll, who is chair, in September. Stroll said Aston Martin will start generating cash later this year, giving the benefits of heavy investment. He added:  We have a big third and fourth quarter coming up.      10.52am BST  Reckitt Benckiser to sell off brands including Cillit Bang in revamp  Reckitt Benckiser is to sell off a portfolio of brands including household names including Air Wick, Calgon and Cillit Bang, and said it will review options for the infant formula business which has dragged it into disastrous lawsuits in the US. The Dettol-to-Durex maker said it is to sell off its slower-growing homecare products business, which generates annual revenues of £1.9bn, by the end of next year. The beleaguered company is also considering all options for its Mead Johnson Nutrition business, which in March saw a court in the US award $60m in damages to a woman whose premature baby died in intensive care after consuming the company’s Enfamil formula. Reckitt Benckiser spent $18bn buying the US-listed maker of baby milk formula in 2017.The company said:  These actions are the result of a thorough review conducted over the last nine months. This sharpened portfolio creates the opportunity to move to a simpler, faster and more efficient organisation.  Shares in Reckitt Benckiser rose as much as 5% in early trading on the news, although they remain down more than 23% over the last year. The company, which cut its sales growth target to between 1% and 3%, said that it wants to focus on “power brands” such as Strepsils, Durex, Vanish, Harpic and Dettol. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:  Investors will be happy to see Reckitt streamline the business. News that the Mead Johnson business is also on the chopping block will be welcome. It’s been the subject of extensive litigation in the US, and while Reckitt has maintained stalwart support for innocence, it’s been an ongoing thorn in the side.      10.37am BST   Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has complained that Labour’s economic inheritance from the Conservative party is the worst since the second world war. That may or may not be true, but it seems a short-term certainty boost may be coming through. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, a financial services firm, said:  This morning’s business activity data will have provided welcome news to newly appointed PM Keir Starmer, remaining consistent with a UK economy that is growing at a solid, albeit far from spectacular, pace. Today’s data supports our generally optimistic view on the UK economy, which we think appears primed for an outperformance relative to the rather subdued expectations in 2024. Business and consumer confidence should be propped up by the normalisation in rates of inflation, and the high likelihood of lower Bank of England interest rates, which we expect to start cutting in August. We also see a mild boost to demand from the removal of the election uncertainty and the possibility of closer UK-EU ties under the new Labour government.   It is not all gravy for the UK economy though. The Bank of England may have pause before cutting interest rates in August, particularly given internal arguments over where inflationary pressures are building. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:  Policymakers will likely take a cautious approach to loosening policy amid signs of inflationary pressures pivoting away from services towards manufacturing, where Red Sea shipping delays and higher freight prices are adding to costs again. The renewed hiring trend could also add to pay pressures, sustaining some stickiness of inflation in the coming months      10.02am BST   Britain’s manufacturing and services sectors both reported stronger sales growth this month, according to the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) survey. Survey compiler S&P Global said it was “the strongest increase in total new business since April 2023”. The Labour party has long argued that it will offer stability to businesses, compared with the turmoil of the last eight years since the referendum on leaving the EU. After a landslide victory on 4 July, it appears that the economy will benefit – at least in the short term – from the end of uncertainty over the direction of the government. S&P Global said:  Companies often commented on an improvement in market confidence and the securing of new contracts, following some reports of a pause in client spending decisions prior to the general election.      9.52am BST  UK election triggers 'surge in demand' says PMI survey  The new UK government has been greeted by a “surge in demand” from British businesses, according to the purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying the strongest growth in two years – in stark contrast to its German counterparts. The manufacturing index rose to 51.8 for July, up from 50.9 in June, according to data company S&P Global. Anything below the 50 mark on the index indicates a drop in activity, but above 50 indicates growth. But the PMI survey’s compilers gave a very positive interpretation of the underlying data, saying businesses have reported increased optimism, hiring and demand. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:  The flash PMI survey data for July signal an encouraging start to the second half of the year, with output, order books and employment all growing at faster rates amid rebounding business confidence, while price pressures moderated. The first post-election business survey paints a welcoming picture for the new government, with companies operating across manufacturing and services having gained optimism about the future, reporting a renewed surge in demand and taking on staff in greater numbers. Prices have meanwhile risen at their lowest rate for three and a half years, further raising the prospect of a summer rate cut.  Business confidence fell to a six-month low in June, but rebounded in July, and was only slightly below the two-year high seen in February. S&P Global said:  Manufacturing and services firms were alike in showing greater optimism towards future business activity, amid expectations of improving demand conditions, stronger business investment, interest rate cuts and political stability.      8.54am BST   It is looking like a tricky time for the German economy. This graph shows how GDP contraction often follows close on the heels of negative readings in the purchasing managers’ index: Not even the boost from the Euro 2024 football championships has been able to deliver Germany from weak growth. Competition from Chinese carmakers (who are dominating the electric car market) is a key problem. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:  The elephant in the room is the various structural issues. With respect to the manufacturing sector, the main structural challenges include labour market shortages, an investment backlog in infrastructure, a lack of digitalization, and relatively high energy prices. However, the most significant factor impacting the German manufacturing sector is the increasing loss of global market share of German car and machinery producers to competitors in China. Unfortunately, this problem is here to stay. Germany’s economic downturn is somewhat buffered by a still-growing service sector. However, the situation there is far from comfortable. Firms have even cut jobs, and outstanding business declined faster than in the previous month. Moreover, it appears that the mini boom in tourism, which could be associated with the European football championships, was already over in July as new export business in services shrank.      8.44am BST  German manufacturing turmoil deepens  German business output dropped in July as the manufacturing sector’s woes deepened, to the surprise of economists who had predicted an improvement. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), a widely followed measure of business activity, dropped from 45.1 points to 42.2, a nine-month low, according to data company S&P Global. Anything below the 50 mark on the index indicates a drop in activity. The German services sector still reported an expansion in output, at 52 points, but the manufacturing weakness drove the composite reading down below 50. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, which sponsors the survey of executives, said he now expected German GDP to fall by 0.4% in the third quarter. He said:  This looks like a serious problem. Germany’s economy fell back into contraction territory, dragged down by a steep and dramatic fall in manufacturing output. The hope that this sector could benefit from a better global economic climate is vanishing into thin air. While it is still early days and many data points are yet to come, the second half of the year is starting on a very weak note.      8.23am BST  'Oscars of advertising' owner to be bought by FTSE 100 rival  Informa, the FTSE 100 events business, has made a £1.2bn cash offer for Ascential, which owns global conferences including Money20/20 and Cannes Lions, the “Oscars of advertising”. Ascential recently completed the sale of its retail data operation WGSN to private equity group Apax for £700m, and its digital commerce business to global advertising group Omnicom for £740m. The company, which employs about 700 people, said in March it intends to return £850m to shareholders following those sales. Stephen Carter, the chief executive of Informa, said:  Informa is in the business of creating, nurturing and growing world class business-to-business brands. Lions and Money20/20 are outstanding examples of such brands. Combined, we can expand them into more sectors, accelerate growth and take advantage of new opportunities.      8.17am BST   The broader FTSE 100 index has dropped by 0.42%, amid general stock market gloom across Europe.

That erases its losses for the week. Before today it was down 16% for the year; now that is back to 8%. You can see the slump and the subsequent recovery in this share price chart, which shows its performance during July.     8.08am BST  EasyJet positive after Ryanair gloom; Heathrow airport has first-half passenger record  Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. EasyJet has said it expects a “record-breaking summer” after the airline revealing a 16% jump in profits, in contrast to the weaker sales expected by Irish rival Ryanair. The Irish carrier’s shares slumped by 17% on Monday after it shocked investors with a steep fall in profits and expectation of falling ticket prices. That drove other airlines down, including a 7% drop for easyJet. The Ryanair surprise had hung over the Farnborough air show in Hampshire, where the global aviation industry has gathered for a biennial meeting. The aviation industry has mostly been in positive mood as it pushes to meet soaring global demand – although it has offered very little answer to how it will cut total carbon emissions in the coming decades.   Related: Ryanair profits plunge by nearly half amid lower summer fares   Yet easyJet on Wednesday reported profits of £236m in the second quarter of 2024, up from £203m during the same period last year. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the company had seen “strong performance in the quarter”. He said:  This result was achieved despite Easter falling into March this year, demonstrating the continued importance of travel and this means we remain on track to deliver another record-breaking summer, taking us a step closer to our medium term targets.  EasyJet’s revenues rose by 11% year-on-year to £2.6bn, and it said it had already sold 1.5m more seats for the summer than at the same point last year. Heathrow says 30 June was busiest day ever London Heathrow airport has said it is enjoying an “exceptional start to the year” after a record number of people travelled through it in the first six months. Europe’s busiest airport reported a 1% drop in revenues for the first half of 2024 to £1.7bn, but it said that 39.8m passengers flew to and from it. 30 June was the airport’s busiest day ever, with over 268,000 passengers travelling on over 1,300 flights.

      "The budget airline easyJet is predicting a record-breaking summer of travel after profits jumped 16% in its most recent quarter of trading. The bumper figures come only two days after the rival no-frills carrier Ryanair reported a plunge in earnings and a poor outlook for the holiday getaway season, pushing down many European airline stocks. EasyJet said pre-tax profits climbed to £236m in the three months to the end of June, as passenger numbers rose by 8%, fuelling an 11% rise in total revenues to £2.6bn. Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet, said the airline had sold 1.5m more seats for peak season than at the same time last year, which “means we remain on track to deliver another record-breaking summer”.   Related: Airlines may have to disclose carbon impact of individuals’ flights under new UK policy   EasyJet said it had filled 28.1m seats in its most recent quarter, up 7% year on year, with load factor across its fleet hitting 92% in June. Jittery investors slashed 7% from easyJet’s share price on Monday after Ryanair said its profits had halved over the same April to June period and forecast a tough summer amid falling ticket prices hindered by a wider market trend of customers leaving booking their summer flights until late. However, easyJet said on Wednesday that its bookings for the summer quarter “continue to build”, with 69% now sold, up a percentage point on the same period last year as the airline increased the number of tickets on sale by 7%. Lundgren distanced his airline from Ryanair: “We don’t actually have the same network. We overlap just about, I think, 20%. [easyJet] Holidays makes a difference. When you’re looking at the fares, it’s pretty much in line with last year. The average fare for the [last quarter] was £73.” Revenue per seat from travellers also increased by 1% year on year in the quarter, with that bump expected to continue through the summer period. EasyJet said its holidays offering performed strongly, with profit before tax up 49% year on year to £73m as passenger numbers soared by 33%. The airline increased its annual profit target for easyJet holidays from £170m to £180m. Lundgren said destinations and sales appeared unaffected by either extreme heat or the recent protests in some Mediterranean countries against mass tourism: “If you’re looking through what is the most popular one, it would be kind of the usual suspects. Turkey and the Greek islands, that whole area is doing really well for us – there’s no big difference.” He said local concerns about overtourism was an issue that had come up from time to time, and easyJet was “mindful” of it, but it was not impacting travel. “Mallorca’s GDP dependency on tourism is close to 50%, as an example, but that needs to be fairly and evenly distributed,” he said. The results and outlook helped send easyJet’s shares up almost 6% in early trading, all but wiping out the losses earlier in the week. “The strong share price reaction to this update at the open adds to investors remaining defiantly confident that sunnier times are returning and that the group is on a strong flight path,” said Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor. “There seems to be an increasing body of evidence to suggest that the family holiday remains almost sacrosanct and outside of normal budgetary restraints, which has played into the hands of easyJet and its keenly priced offerings of flights and holiday packages.” \n",
      "UK business activity expanded this month after a sharp rise in new sales to a 15-month high, giving a lift to the new government as it prepares to outline the state of the public finances next week, according to a survey of private-sector firms. A fall in inflation across the services sector was also expected to ease concerns at the Bank of England about persistent price rises before a meeting of the central bank’s policymakers next week. The S&P Global flash UK composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) – which includes manufacturing and services – reported a reading of 52.7 in July, up from 52.3 in June. The increase was above the expectations of City economists, who had pencilled in a rise to 52.5. The manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 from 50.9 in June, its highest level for two years, while the service sector was at a two-month high of 52.4, up from 52.1. S&P said the flash figures were based on preliminary data. Any score above 50 indicates that activity is growing, while below 50 means it is contracting.  Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the figures represented “an encouraging start to the second half of the year”, with output, order books and employment all growing at faster rates amid rebounding business confidence. “The first post-election business survey paints a welcoming picture for the new government, with companies operating across manufacturing and services having gained optimism about the future, reporting a renewed surge in demand and taking on staff in greater numbers,” he said. “Prices have meanwhile risen at their lowest rate for three and a half years, further raising the prospect of a summer rate cut.” Services firms reported that they had put redundancy plans on ice and were recruiting again after last year’s recession had sparked fears of widespread layoffs. Manufacturers were buoyant after a rise in orders, though a rise in shipping costs meant firms cut back on purchases of components and raw materials. The balance of firms that pushed up prices versus those that cut prices showed the smallest increase since February 2021. The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meets on 1 August, but is expected to delay a first rate cut in more than four years until at least September. Williamson said the Bank was likely to take “a cautious approach to loosening policy” amid signs of inflationary pressures “pivoting away from services towards manufacturing”, where Red Sea shipping delays and higher freight prices were adding to costs again. “The renewed hiring trend could also add to pay pressures, sustaining some stickiness of inflation in the coming months,” he added.\n",
      "The price of popular ice-creams and lollies including Cornetto and Solero have soared by more than 30% over the past two years amid the rising cost of ingredients and energy. Analysts at the consumer group Which? have suggested switching to supermarket own-label options that are cheaper and – their study suggests – often tastier. The biggest price increase spotted by Which? was on a six-pack of Cornetto strawberry ice-cream cones, which rose from £2.57 to £3.55 – a 38% increase – between 2022 and 2024. The pack costs £1.56 more – 26p a cone – than similar own-label items from Asda and Lidl that a Which? blind taste test found to be more satisfying and tasty. A four-pack of similar cones from Morrisons, which scored the same in the taste test as the Asda and Lidl versions, was priced at £1.50 – 21p a cone cheaper than the Cornetto. Which? looked at average prices at major supermarkets in the two months to 8 July this year compared with the same period two years earlier, including regular discounts, but not multibuys or loyalty scheme offers. A six-pack of Cornetto Classico cones increased in price by a similar amount to its strawberry equivalent – 35%, from £2.57 to £3.48 – during the same time period. However, Cornetto was less well liked than others in Which?’s test. More than a third of testers wanted the ice-cream to be creamier, and more than a quarter said it lacked sweetness. Costs have risen for producers – on energy, labour, transport and ingredients including milk, cocoa and sugar – meaning the average factory gate price of ice-cream has risen by 27% in the past two years, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, the price of some brands outstripped that. A three pack of Solero Exotic ice-cream lollies rose 35% to £2.75, while a four-pack of Feast chocolate ice-creams jumped by 28% to £3.11. The Which? blind taste test named Aldi Gianni’s Tropico exotic fruit lollies – which cost £1.35 for three – as a best buy, after they scored 76% compared with 70% for Solero. While Cornetto and Solero are produced by Unilever, other consumer goods companies also pushed through big price rises. A six-pack of Fab strawberry fruity lollies, made by Nestlé, increased in price by 23% to £2.43, while the price of a four-pack of its Rowntree’s Fruit Pastilles lollies was up 22% to £2.43. However, there was good news for Magnum lovers. The price of a three-pack of Magnum double gold caramel billionaires, made by Unilever, fell 2% to £3.63. Ele Clark, the Which? retail editor, said: “Few of us can resist an ice-cream on a hot summer’s day, but the price hikes our research has revealed could leave ice-cream lovers feeling cold. “Thankfully, Which?’s tests have unearthed some own-brand supermarket alternatives that taste better and cost less than their big-brand rivals.” A spokesperson for Unilever, which makes Cornetto, Feast, Magnum and Solero, said: “We are committed to using the highest-quality ingredients for our ice-cream products and regularly review our ranges to ensure we continue to offer choice, superior quality and value to our shoppers by offering a range of product sizes to suit different shopper preferences, needs and budgets. “The retail price of our products is always at the sole discretion of the retailer and we, like all manufacturers, only provide a recommended retail price.” A spokesperson for Froneri, the company that makes ice-cream for Nestlé brands under licence, said retail pricing was always at the discretion of individual retailers. “Like every manufacturer, we have been experiencing significant cost increases, making it much more expensive to manufacture our products. We have been working to be more efficient and absorb increasing costs where possible. However, in order to maintain the highest standards of quality, it has sometimes been necessary to make adjustments to the price of some of our products,” they said.\n",

The company is aiming to sell a share of projects in a joint venture with Iberdrola’s Scottish Power which is meant to develop as much as 5 gigawatts of floating wind power plants, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named by Bloomberg because the matter is private. The news outlet said spokespeople for both Shell and Scottish Power declined to comment. Last year, Shell abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year.     2.40pm BST  Spotify shares hit 3-year high, up 15%  Spotify’s NYSE-listed shares have jumped 15% at the start of trading to hit a three year* high. *Corrected: previously said three month high   Updated at 2.53pm BST    2.33pm BST   US markets are open for trading and it’s a much weaker picture than the start of yesterday’s session:   S&P 500 is 0.02% Dow is up 0.02% Nasdaq is down 0.13%      2.15pm BST   Operating costs at Spotify dropped in the second quarter, primarily due to a wave of job cuts in recent months.  In the run-up to Christmas the company announced a 17% cut to its global workforce, about 1,500 jobs, having cut 800 staff in the previous year.  Spotify said on Tuesday that its operating expenses dropped 16% in second quarter, compared to a year earlier, the bulk of which “reflected a decrease in personnel and related costs” as well as the amount it spent on marketting.      1.54pm BST  Spotify shares surge in pre-market trading after profit margins hit record-high  Swedish streaming service Spotify has seen its shares jump 14% in pre-market trading.  It comes after the New York-listed audio platform reported record-high profit margins of 29.2% in the second quarter, as bruising cost cuts started to translate into stronger finances.  The company also benefited from a rise in the number of premium subscriptions, helping push revenues up 20% to €3.81bn. However, that was slightly below analyst forecasts for €3.82bn. It also fell short of a self-imposed target of 631 million monthly active users, hitting just 626 million in the quarter.  Overall, profits rose to€274m profit, up from a €302m loss a year earlier. Spotify CEO Daniel Elk told Reuters that he took the missed target “seriously”:  It’s definitely something we take very seriously, if we miss our own forecasts. For me, it’s a question of when, not if: we will return to strong MAU growth, I feel good about it.      1.25pm BST   Businesses are expected to cancel their attendance at this year’s Conservative conference in unprecedented numbers, in a chastening snub that could also undermine the party’s ability to raise funds, my colleague Rob Davies writes.  The annual gathering, due to be held in Birmingham from 29 September to 2 October, would usually attract corporate attendees willing to pay tens of thousands of pounds to get close to MPs with influence over policy. But Labour’s landslide general election victory means this year’s event is on track to be the least popular in living memory, according to several public affairs firms and business leaders. They said the conference was likely to be less well attended by business leaders than the one held after Tony Blair’s 1997 victory and even Labour conferences under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Katherine Morgan, head of public affairs for Europe at the global advisory group DGA said:   The lack of appetite among business for the Conservative party conference is no doubt fuelled not just by the attractiveness of Labour, but also a realisation that the Conservative party is at a real inflection point. The challenge for the Conservatives will be ensuring that September marks the beginning of the journey towards re-establishing their credentials as ‘the party of business’.  Several large agencies are understood to have cancelled dinners they were due to host at the event or scaled back the number of people they are sending.

The Match of the Day host’s contract is due to run out next year, amid speculation over whether he will remain after a long-running series of public clashes with the corporation that culminated in a staff mutiny last year. Huw Edwards, who left the broadcaster earlier this year after a media scandal, was the BBC’s third highest paid star on £475,000 after spending most of the year signed off on medical leave. The pay disclosures only cover payments directly from the BBC, meaning they do not cover income paid via third parties – meaning income earned by Amol Rajan and Fiona Bruce on University Challenge or Antiques Roadshow is not included.     12.10pm BST  Half a million households cancelled BBC licence fee last year  Half a million households cancelled their licence fee last year as the BBC struggled to connect with younger audiences drifting away to Netflix and YouTube. The stark extent of the BBC’s challenges are set out in the corporation’s annual report, which shows the total number of British households paying the £169.50 licence fee fell to 23.9 million, suggesting a growing number of people feel able to go without BBC services. The fall has hit the BBC’s income at a time when its finances were already struggling due to a decade of funding cuts and high inflation. Some of the most worrying numbers for the BBC show how young people increasingly feel the broadcaster is not relevant to their lives. Just 69% of Britons aged under 16 said they consumed any BBC content in an average week, with a particular weakness among people from an ethnic minority background. The figures are even worse for younger age groups, with under-7s in particular tuned out, with the BBC saying it is struggling to compete against “global media companies” for these crucial future viewers.

The figures are an indication of the stock of houses in the pipeline for construction, since they have to be registered before being built.  About 29,281 new homes were registered to be built between April to June, down from 37,861 a year earlier, the data showed.  Meanwhile, 33,847 new homes were completed in the period, down 6% year-on-year. Quarter on quarter figures were much better, though, suggesting an uptick as the year has gone on. New home registrations and completions increased by 34% and 29% respectively, compared to Q1.  The data will be closely watched, with the new Labour government having pledged to reform the planning system to unleash a building spree, and built 1.5 million more homes over the course of the parliament. Last week, Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said:   We know we have a mountain to climb. That is why we’re already taking the first steps, starting with an overhaul of our planning system - a reform that will both help build the homes we need and speed up the infrastructure to support them. We are committed not just to an ambitious target for overall housebuilding but the biggest wave of social and affordable housing for a generation. It’s a promise that we’ll bring back with meaningful housing targets.      11.55am BST  Horizon inquiry: Ex-postal minister says she was 'never told' why prosecutions of sub-postmasters halted  Baroness Neville-Rolfe, the postal minister at the time the Post Office decided to stop prosecuting sub-postmasters, was never told that a key factor was because the Post Office could no longer find an expert witness willing to testify about the integrity of the flawed Horizon IT system and its data.Neville-Rolfe, the former long serving Tesco executive who held the role of postal minister for 14 months until July 2016, has said that she only found out the reasons why the Post Office stopped the relentless prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters when it was revealed as part of the public inquiry.During the time Neville-Rolfe held the ministerial position, the Post Office stopped prosecutions after internal advice concluded that Gareth Jenkins, a Fujitsu engineer who formed the backbone of the Horizon integrity defence against sub-postmasters, that his testimony was materially misleading and in breach of court rules.“I didn’t know any of that at the time,” said Neville-Rolfe, who within three months of taking office asked new Post Office chair Tim Parker to look at the Horizon scandal with “fresh eyes” and examine the concerns about the IT system with an independent review,  Speaking at the inquiry on Tuesday, she said:   Looking back at hindsight I was getting unending, always the same, advice from the Shareholder Executive [Shareholder Executive, which manages government-owned assets and had a member on the board who is supposed to represent its interests].  It was very black and white.  I wasn’t aware [of the reasons prosecutions ended] until the inquiry. These were civil servants, I’d been a civil servant. You have a duty to be objective and truthful.  Neville-Rolfe also held meetings with Paul Vennells, the chief executive of the Post Office, which also served to reinforce the line that the Horizon IT system was not faulty.  I was told in all directions there wasn’t an issue. I was trying to find a way through to get further work done.  I was aware there were murmurings, especially among a few MPs, of some particularly troubling cases. I was worried I wasn’t getting broad enough advice from officials, the department or more broadly.      11.36am BST  Porsches shares down after car maker issues profit warning  Porsche shares are down 4.5% and at the bottom of Frankfurt’s blue chip Dax index, after warning that a shortage of aluminium would drag down its profits.  The German luxury sports car maker said flooding at an unnamed European contractor would hit aluminium supplies would affect – and potentially lead to shutdowns of –vehicle production.  Analysts at Bernstein, who said the flooding had been at a Swiss supplier, explained that it would result in at least 10,000-17,400 fewer vehicles being produced in the second half of 2024:  Whether self-inflicted or genuinely outside its control, these have significantly tarnished what had been an extremely successful IPO in September 2022. Porsche will certainly be closely questioned over its cluster risk management that has left it so vulnerable to one critical supplier.  The company said its operating profits margins would likely be between 14-15% this year, compared to earlier forecasts for 15%-17%.  Meanwhile, annual sales forecasts have been downgraded to between €39bn-€40bn, down from previous expectations for sales of between €40bn-€42bn.      10.22am BST   Elon Musk’s comments, which revived humanoid robot plans, came just hours before Tesla is due to report Q2 earnings. However, it’s unlikely to be a cheery affair, with the electric carmaker expected to see its profits fall for the sixth quarter in a row. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank explains:  Despite almost doubling its stock price between April and July, Tesla sees appetite for its cars and its market share under pressure, and the company’s operating profit is expected to shrink in the Q2 for the sixth straight quarter. What keeps optimism alive for Tesla is the robotaxi plan. But robotaxis will cost to the company before it can generate profit. Therefore, the recent gains may not find a solid ground to let the share price extend gains The key support to the robotaxi-led rally stands at $220 per share, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on April to July rebound.  Earlier this month, Tesla said its global sales fell for the second straight quarter despite price cuts and low-interest financing offers, in further signs of weakening demand for its products. Tesla had knocked around $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the US in April. That included the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the US, and also of the Models X and S. It also knocked roughly a third off the price of its “Full Self Driving” system – which can’t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene. All eyes will be on Tesla’s outlook, which will be released alongside earnings after US markets close on Tuesday.  Updated at 10.29am BST    9.42am BST   Full story: The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has claimed the company will produce “genuinely useful” humanoid robots to start working in its factories next year. The world’s richest person, who has a penchant for making overambitious claims on social media, posted on his platform X, formerly Twitter, that he also hoped to expand into “high production” mode to make robots with a humanlike form available sell to other companies in 2026. Musk, who owns X and is also the boss of SpaceX, has previously made bold claims about when the robot, called Optimus, would be ready for commercial use.  In 2021, the billionaire, estimated by Forbes to be worth $250bn (£194bn), said he expected the mechanoid to be ready for use in Tesla factories the following year. Optimus is about 1.7 metres tall and weighs 56kg; it is designed to do “boring, repetitious and dangerous” work.  The name is an allusion to Optimus Prime, the powerful and benevolent leader of the Autobots in the Transformers media franchise. Optimus is not the only Musk project to be running behind his initial projections. In 2019, he said he felt “very confident” Tesla would have self-driving taxis on the road the following year.

Official figures released  last week showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter – much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. The central’s bank’s decision to cut interest rates yesterday also failed to ease concerns.  Jitters over what this could mean for demand for commodities and metals has now hit copper prices, with the three month copper on the London Metal Exchange falling 1% to $9,123 per metric ton this morning  It has in turn hit mining giants, which tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100.

Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says:  Alphabet’s bold move to accelerate its stack in the cybersecurity space has come to a quick end.  Wiz’s choice to instead grow revenue and look for an IPO will come as a blow, especially as the valuation offered by Alphabet was double the level at which Wiz secured its latest funding back in May.  Alphabet is behind its key cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon when it comes to offering a complete stack of cyber security products.  With demand for cloud comput[ing] only going one way, and the risk posed by cyber attacks on the rise, having a strong set of cyber products will be a key attraction for enterprises. More M&A action in the cyber space feels inevitable.      8.43am BST  TSB profit falls 25% due to mortgage market weakness  High street lender TSB suffered a 24.5% drop in profits in the first half of the year, after being hit by heightened competition and a slowdown in the mortgage market.  Profits fell to £111.6m in the six months to June, down from £147.9m a year earlier.  The bank said it reflected “lower mortgage margins in challenging market conditions” as well as a jump in the money paid out to savers as it tried to avoid an outflow of deposits to rival banks offering higher rates. Year-on-year, customer deposits were down by £4m to £35bn. Mortgage lending was impacted by high interest rates, which caused fewer consumers to borrow. But it meant banks were left to compete fewer customers, which put further pressure on lenders to reduce the cost of borrowing where possible.  It squeezed TSB’s net interest margin to 2.62%. That was 22 basis points lower than H1 2023, when it sat at 2.84%. Total income fell 6.1% to £548.7m.  The bank also took a £19m impairment loss on bad loans.  TSB CEO Robin Bulloch said.    Our focus in 2024 is making TSB simpler and easier to bank with and I’m delighted to see more customers choosing TSB.  We continue to make good progress against our strategy, and I’d like to thank everyone at TSB for their continued efforts to support our customers and communities, helping them feel more money confident.  The results comes as TSB prepares to defend itself in court today in a case related to historic mortgage debts.  A group of about 2,500 Northern Rock customers are seeking compensation from TSB’s subsidiary Whistletree, which bought their loans after Northern Rock collapsed.

We start the day with comments from none other than Tesla boss Elon Musk, who has revived the prospects of his company rolling out humanoid robots. In comments made on his social media platform X, Musk claimed the electric carmaker will start using and eventually selling “useful humanoid robots” from next year.  Tesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 22, 2024  It could be a lucrative business plan, though Musk has previously said that Tesla could mass produce the robots and sell them for less than $20,000 each. But whether he can meet the self-imposed deadline remains to be seen. Remember that Musk previously said he expected Tesla would have self-driving taxis on the road within a year…that was back in 2019. Meanwhile, Google’s parent company Alphabet has had its $23bn offer for Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz have been rebuffed. It would have been the biggest deal in Alphabet’s history, and the largest takeover of a venture capital-backed company. While there has bene no public statement explaining why Wiz walked away from talks, the company reportedly sent an employee-wide email on Monday, saying:  While we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue our path to building Wiz.  However, reports suggest there were also internal disagreements. Some board members at both companies were said to be concerned over whether the deal would gain approval from regulators, while other directors actively opposed the takeover. Wiz, which was founded by alumni of Israel’s cyber intelligence unit, and was last valued at $12bn, will now pursue an initial public offering, according to reports.

      "Two-fifths of British growers of strawberries and raspberries could go out of business by the end of 2026 amid rising costs and poor pay from supermarkets, according to a study. Almost half of British growers said they no longer make a profit and 53% reported the financial health of their business as bad or very bad, according to a survey by British Berry Growers (BBG), an industry body that represents farmers producing 95% of the berries sold in the UK. If problems are not addressed BBG warned of “a future massive reduction in the supply of fresh British berries”.   Related: Food giants are strangling Britain’s farmers and consumers. What’s the solution? Break them up | Nicholas Shaxson   More than a third of those surveyed – 37% – are already considering reducing their production or moving out of berry farming entirely, while 39% said their relationship with retailers had never been this bad, according to the study. Nick Marston, the chair of BBG, said: “We must take this survey as a wake-up call and a sign to take urgent action. The future of this great sector hangs in the balance. It would be a travesty to lose British berries. “We need support from retailers in the form of fair returns, but we also need support from the government to ensure we have an uninterrupted supply of pickers during our peak season.” The cost of production has risen 30% for growers but this has not been reflected in the prices paid by retailers, he added. While the cost of a punnet of strawberries in the shops went up by an average 27p between 2021 and last year, for example, growers’ returns only increased by 3.5p. “Our belief is that growers are not seeing their fair share of that inflation,” Marston said. Supermarkets are working hard to source food locally and ensure consumers can “afford the essentials”, said Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium trade body. “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and value the strong relationships they have with farmers,” he added. “Retailers are also working incredibly hard to limit price increases for consumers given many people are struggling to afford the essentials.” But Marston warned that the problem was already having an effect as production of strawberries was down 5% this year despite good growing conditions as farmers moved out of the market altogether or reduced their planting area. BBG wants the government to increase the length of the seasonal worker scheme visa for overseas pickers from six to nine months so that people are available throughout the growing season. It also wants improvements to the export system to make it easier for growers to take advantage of market opportunities in the EU and farther afield. Marston said the volume of berry exports had fallen to a seventh of pre-Brexit levels because of the introduction of complex rules such as phytosanitary checks since the UK left the EU.\n",
      "The cybersecurity firm Wiz has turned down a $23bn (£18bn) takeover bid from Google’s parent, Alphabet, spurning what would have been the tech company’s biggest ever acquisition and seeking a stock market flotation instead. Alphabet had been in talks with Wiz, founded by alumni of Israel’s cyberintelligence unit, as it seeks to catch rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market. Wiz offers a service that scans the data on cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for security risks.   Related: CrowdStrike says significant number of devices back online after global outage   The New York-based startup, which has the backing of investors including Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, was most recently valued at $12bn. “While we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz,” the company told employees in an internal email. In a memo the Wiz chief executive, Assaf Rappaport, outlined the next targets of reaching $1bn in annual recurring revenue and an initial public offering. “Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice,” he said. “The market validation we have experienced following this news only reinforces our goal – creating a platform that both security and development teams love.” Neither Wiz nor Google had released official statements about the termination of the deal talks by Tuesday morning. There has been scepticism that the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking. In December, Adobe abandoned its $20bn takeover of its smaller rival Figma, after European and UK regulators raised concerns that it would eliminate competition in the product design software market. Last month, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. Wiz, founded in 2020, was valued at $12bn during a funding round in May that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive. Wiz says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its customers, and that it is making $350m in annual recurring revenue.\n",
      "The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has said he is confident that the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast will continue to build ships for the Royal Navy, despite ruling out government support for the struggling company. Harland & Wolff is part of a consortium on a £1.6bn contract to build three naval fleet solid support ships to supply the Royal Navy’s aircraft carriers. However, it has faced months of uncertainty over its future. The government on Monday confirmed that it had refused to grant a £200m loan guarantee to help the struggling company to refinance. The shipbuilder had hoped to secure a guarantee of up to 80% of any loan value to help it avoid collapsing into administration for the second time in five years. But the guarantee would have put taxpayer money at risk if the shipyard fails. Harland & Wolff’s precarious finances add to a series of industrial policy challenges already mounting up for the Labour government, including the prospect of job losses at Tata Steel’s plant in south Wales, and the proposed takeover of Royal Mail’s owner by the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Reynolds also revealed on Monday that the government was likely to call in Křetínský’s Royal Mail bid for a formal review. Speaking to reporters at the Farnborough international airshow in Hampshire, Reynolds said support for Harland & Wolff “would not have been a prudent use of government money”. However, asked if he was confident that Royal Navy ships would still be built in Belfast, he answered simply: “Yes.” His confidence will be a boost to the workforce of about 1,500 in Belfast and at H&W’s other shipyards in Devon and Scotland. Matt Roberts, national officer at GMB, a union representing workers at the yards, said that they must be saved. “These are worrying times for workers and their families in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the south-west,” he said. “These yards have been at the heart of UK manufacturing for centuries, from building the Titanic to the ships that defeated the Armada.” Reynolds said he expected a “market-led solution” to refinancing the company’s large debt load, and added that he thought the promise of government support had delayed efforts to find private sector lenders. The shipbuilder was forced to suspend its London-listed shares a fortnight ago, raising concerns about its future. Its chief executive, John Wood, left abruptly on Friday, his departure understood to be a condition imposed by lenders. The US investor Riverstone is reportedly considering a new loan. On Royal Mail, Reynolds said he would talk to Křetínský this week, after discussions on Monday between the investor and unions. “I think it would be reasonable to expect it to be called in,” he said, pointing to the previous review when Křetínský first increased his shareholding. He added that he would look at how the government could receive binding assurances that jobs and some crucial services could be retained. Reynolds and several other cabinet ministers were accompanying Keir Starmer on Monday to the Farnborough airshow, where executives from the aviation and weapons industries gather every two years.\n",
      "A group of Northern Rock customers who claim they became “mortgage prisoners” after the lender’s collapse are to go to court on Tuesday to try to get compensation from the bank that bought their loans. About 2,500 borrowers whose home loans were sold to TSB’s subsidiary Whistletree are involved in a case over what they say are inflated interest rates on their debt. Rather than being put on TSB’s normal standard variable rate (SVR) when they were transferred, they have been charged a separate rate, which is higher. While the TSB rate now stands at 7.25%, Whistletree’s equivalent is at 9.54%. The group of current and former Whistletree borrowers are part of a wider cohort of about 47,000 households who had loans with Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley until the banks failed in the 2008 financial crisis. Many had taken out interest-only mortgages, some had self-certificated their income, rather than having to prove it, and some took on loans of more than 100% loan to value (LTV). These circumstances have meant that some have been unable to switch to a new, cheaper deal, meaning they came to be known as “mortgage prisoners”. About 27,000 mortgage holders were transferred to Whistletree in 2016. Since then, more than two-thirds of Whistletree customers have switched to a different deal or closed their mortgage, but those on its SVR have paid more than if they were on TSB’s equivalent variable rate. Olivia Selley, senior associate at the law firm taking the action, Harcus Parker, said that this meant these borrowers may have paid £15,000-£30,000 more than had they been on the better rate. She said the court proceedings, expected to take four days, would examine whether the decision to put the borrowers on a separate SVR had breached the contract that they had with Northern Rock and whether there was an implied term that rates should not be set unfairly or capriciously. The court’s decision, expected in the autumn, will set the terms for further action by the borrowers. Rachel Neale, lead campaigner for the UK Mortgage Prisoners Action Group, said: “After six years of tough campaigning for justice, UK Mortgage Prisoners action group hope that Harcus Parker solicitors are successful in this aspect of justice for our members. “Additionally, we call upon government to right the broader wrongs that only legislative reform can bring about for mortgage prisoners in order to right the wrongs government knowingly enabled.” TSB said that, since 2017, it had made new deals available to Whistletree borrowers at the same price as those available through the main bank, and that it now allowed those who were behind on repayments to switch to a better rate. A spokesperson said: “Whistletree customers are not mortgage prisoners. Since we took over the management of these mortgages, over two-thirds of Whistletree customers have either moved to a new mortgage or closed their mortgage with Whistletree. We remind customers they can switch at least annually, and this is displayed prominently on the Whistletree website.” Commenting on the court action, he said: “This is a hearing for the court to determine some specific issues that have been raised as part of Harcus Parker’s legal action relating to Whistletree mortgage terms and conditions, in advance of any final trial. TSB has always been committed to treating Whistletree customers fairly, does not believe the claim has merit and is defending it vigorously.”\n",
      "Tax cuts starting this month should start to reduce the number of Australian households facing mortgage stress provided the jobs market holds up and the Reserve Bank doesn’t hit them with higher interest rates, according to a RoyMorgan report. The research firm found more than 1.6 million mortgage holders, or 30.3% of the total, were facing mortgage stress in June, up 88,000 from the previous month.   Related: Australia’s unemployment rate inches higher to 4.1% in June making a rate cut less likely   The tally, based on a calculation of after-tax income, spending and debt size, was slightly down on the start of 2024 and below the record 35.8% share during the global financial crisis in 2008. Those deemed “extremely at risk” – based on their share of household income being spent on repayments and outstanding debt – topped 1.016 million, about 20% of mortgage holders. That level compared with a 14.5% proportion over the past decade.  Mortgage stress remains high, although down a little from peaks earlier in the year. Stage three tax cuts should see the levels ease a bit - provided the jobs market holds up, @RoyMorganAus says. pic.twitter.com/vq3u9RajWL— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) July 23, 2024  Michele Levine, Roy Morgan’s chief executive, said the strong labour market including 673,000 jobs created in the past year, had “provided support to household incomes which have helped to moderate levels of mortgage stress since the highs of early 2024”. Some relief would also come in the form of the stage-three tax cuts that take effect this month, provided unemployment rates don’t rise sharply and the Reserve Bank doesn’t lift its cash rate again.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  “The stage-three income tax cuts are delivering significant financial relief, and a boost to take home pay, for millions of Australian taxpayers – including many mortgage holders,” Levine said. The RBA board meets on 31 July with investors betting there is only about one-in-four chance of an interest rate hike. June quarter inflation figures out on 31 July could shift those odds, particularly if they exceed the 3.8% CPI level the bank had modelled in its May forecast. Mortgage stress has been elevated after the RBA’s 13 rate rises and the number of those falling behind on repayments has been increasing. The proportion reporting arrears was 1.6% in the March quarter, up from 1% in the September quarter of 2022 but still slightly below the pre-Covid level of 1.8%, CoreLogic has noted. Other signs that consumers might be feeling more confident as the tax cuts arrive include the latest weekly consumer sentiment survey by ANZ and Roy Morgan. Its main gauge reached a six-month high, the two organisations reported on Tuesday.  Latest weekly survey by @ANZ_Research and @RoyMorganAus has consumer confidence ticking up to a six-month high. Inflation expectations are moderating a bit too... pic.twitter.com/jCDnSdk6ur— @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) July 23, 2024  “Notably, households’ confidence in their current financial situation was the second highest since early-2023,” the ANZ economist Madeline Dunk said. “This suggests households may be starting to see a boost to their incomes from the stage-three tax cuts and other cost-of-living relief measures.” Mortgage stress, though, may be something a portion of the population might not get to experience if the cost of buying a home prevents people from entering the market. A study to appear in the October edition of the journal Cities looked at the affordability of the greater Sydney property market from 2004 to 2021 given varying employment contracts and projected how conditions were likely to change out to 2031. “The forecasted entry affordability shows there is nowhere in greater Sydney where the mere reliance on NSW median part-time or median full-time income could make entry to the market possible,” the study found. “This means prospective home buyers will require support elsewhere or scale down their housing desire,” it said.\n",
      "More than 1,500 jobs are to go at Carpetright as a rescue deal for the retailer by its rival Tapi Carpets & Floors saves only a fifth of its stores and 300 employee roles. The multimillion-pound deal, finalised on Monday, includes 54 stores but not Carpetright’s head office in Purfleet, Essex, while another 219 shops will close. The advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been looking for a buyer for Carpetright after it filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator earlier in July. It said 1,018 jobs would go immediately in the pre-pack administration deal while a further 580 jobs, mostly at the group’s head office, are expected to go once the handover to Tapi is complete. Customers around the country will also face disappointment, as PwC said orders placed with stores not included in the deal could not be fulfilled. It suggested affected customers contact their payment card provider about the possibility of obtaining a refund. Zelf Hussain, a joint administrator, said: “Carpetright has fallen victim to challenges facing many retailers, especially those selling big-ticket items.” He said other factors including a big reduction in consumer spending due to cost of living pressures, lower home sales and a “debilitating cyber-attack” in April this year made it “impossible for the business to continue in its current form”.   Related: John Lewis trials repair service in partnership with Timpson Group   Tapi has been a bitter rival to Carpetright since it was co-founded in 2015 by Martin Harris, the son of the “carpet king” Lord Harris of Peckham. Harris launched Tapi a year after he and his father stepped down as directors of Carpetright, which Lord Harris founded in 1988. Martin Harris left Tapi earlier this year, while Lord Harris remains an investor and adviser to the business. The acquisition of Carpetright would enable Tapi to expand into a number of new areas, the company said. Lord Harris continues to have a role on the board of Tapi, which he co-owns with about 1,000 investors, the largest of which is the executive chair, Will Barker of the US investment firm Camelot Capital Partners. Tapi, which has 170 stores, said in a statement it was “desperately sad not to have been able to save more of the business and customer orders”. Jeevan Karir, the managing director of Tapi, added: “Our goal, initially, was to try to save all of Carpetright. However, as we looked into the details of the situation, we quickly established that saving the entire business was unviable. The business has been materially loss-making for a number of years and it has significant debt held by the owner.”  The group said another reason it had not taken on more Carpetright stores was because it was “mindful of how the Competition and Markets Authority may view a larger deal”. Carpetright, which was once FTSE listed, was bought and taken private in 2019 by Meditor, the British hedge fund headed by the poker player Talal Shakerchi. Sales are understood to have fallen more than 45%, to £200m, in the past year, while losses have mounted to more than £25m in recent years along with more than £150m in external debt. Kevin Barrett, the chief executive of Nestware Holdings, the Meditor-controlled group that ran Carpetright, said: “We have tried everything to turn Carpetright around and I’m truly sorry that we were unable to save more jobs. The deal will not affect Carpetright in Europe or other brands within Nestware Holdings including Keswick and Trade Choice. “The Floor Room will continue to trade and serve customers via concessions at John Lewis and we will be working hard to secure job opportunities across these businesses to support Carpetright staff wherever we can.”\n",
      "Ryanair has said its profits plunged by almost half between April and June and warned that fares this summer would be “materially lower” than last year. Europe’s largest airline reported profits of €360m (£303m) in the spring quarter, 46% lower than the same period last year, despite passenger numbers rising 10% to 55.5 million. The downbeat results, which missed analysts’ estimates, drove the budget carrier’s share price down 17% on Monday.   Related: ‘As prepared as we can be’: UK airlines and airports get ready for summer getaway   The news also appeared to have a knock-on effect on other publicly traded airline stocks. EasyJet fell 7%, Wizz Air was down 10% and IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, slipped 3.4%. The shares were also under pressure after airports and airlines around the world were hit by a Microsoft IT outage on Friday that led to the cancellation of more than 5,000 flights. Ryanair said its average fare dropped from €49.07 to €41.93 year on year, but the increase in passenger numbers helped limit the decline in total revenues to 1% at €363bn. The company said while it expected strong demand this summer, with passenger numbers likely to be up 8% overall this financial year, “pricing remains softer than we expected”. “We now expect second-quarter fares [July to September] to be materially lower than last summer,” the company said. “The final first-half outcome is, however, totally dependent on close-in bookings and yields in August and September.” “Close-in bookings” refer to customers waiting much longer than usual to book summer flights. “Cheaper air fares are great for travellers but bad for airlines trying to repair their finances after the pandemic,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. “It puts more pressure on airlines to put bums on seats and fill planes to maximise the revenue potential. While travel demand has bounced back since the pandemic, travellers are reluctant to book too far ahead. That’s possibly because they are feeling the pressure of persistent high interest rates or because they are holding out for a bargain.” The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said the 15% drop in average fare prices in its last quarter may be a “rebalancing” of the market after double-digit percentage ticket price increases in recent years. He added that Ryanair had experienced repeated resistance from customers when it had tried to put up prices, and intended to aggressively market low-cost ticket availability to keep demand high. This month Jet2, the Leeds-based travel company that flies from 12 UK airports to more than 65 destinations in Europe, said customers faced “modest” price rises this summer as it adjusted to the shift to later bookings. Ryanair also said on Monday that it had been hit by air traffic control capacity, which had been restricted by various factors including strikes abroad and increasing gaps between planes to ensure safe landings during extreme weather. “In the last 10 days of June, we suffered a significant deterioration in European air traffic control capacity, which caused multiple flight delays and cancellations, especially on first-wave morning flights,” said O’Leary, who added that this was the worst summer for air traffic control delays that he had ever experienced. “[This makes it] more urgent than ever that the new European Commission and parliament deliver long-delayed reform of Europe’s hopelessly inefficient air traffic control services,” he said. Coatsworth said that the more holidaymakers saw and read about problems with international travel, the more likely it was that they would opt to book a UK break instead. “The more people read about delays and cancellations, the more likely a chunk of potential last-minute bookers aren’t going to bother,” he said. “They might think it’s all too much hassle so they just have a holiday at home. To make matters worse, there is the prospect of the airline industry potentially taking the rest of the week to recover from the global IT meltdown.”\n",
      "Public fury at the water industry can be channelled to achieve lasting change (Letters, 14 July). There are parallels with the revolt that brought down the poll tax. Our campaign – Boycott Thames Water – seeks to overturn the false narrative that taking water back into public ownership is unaffordable. If the Ofwat proposals pass, a water levy will be imposed on every household to pay for the failure of the water companies. The huge percentage hike, on top of inflation, will apply to everyone, irrespective of means. It is a poll tax in all but name. A government committed to fiscal propriety should not stand by and allow this. Many people simply cannot afford water to remain in the hands of rapacious private monopolies. Supporters of groups like ours have been refusing to pay the wastewater element of their bill for months, sometimes years. Water companies cannot cut off domestic supplies, so long as we maintain a dispute they cannot take recovery action. The grounds for prolonging the dispute are many, from the fly‑tipping of our wastewater to the imposition of payment towards interest on their loans. It is not coincidental that the poll tax and water privatisation happened around the same time. We hope a Labour government committed to change can be persuaded by mass action to return water to stewardship based on fairness and care for the environment. The next billing round will be October.

Reynolds said he will talk to Kretinsky about the bid this week, and would look at how the government could receive binding assurances about services in UK’s the national interest.  Secondly, on the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Reynolds said the government was going to hold out for a “market” saviour to rescue the shipyard, and that he was confident that it would continue to build ships for he Royal Navy despite its ongoing financial troubles.  Elsewhere, airline stocks have plunged in the wake of Ryanair’s earnings report, which showed that weak demand from cost-conscious consumers had sent profits down 46% in the first quarter.

We’ll be back tomorrow morning from 8am. –KM     2.55pm BST   BT has been fined more than £17m for missing 14,000 emergency calls after technical faults caused the emergency call handling service to be disrupted for nearly 11 hours last summer. The telecoms regulator launched an investigation shortly after the incident on 25 June 2023. Publishing its findings on Monday, Ofcom said the handling of the network fault was a “catastrophic failure”. The watchdog’s director of enforcement, Suzanne Cater, said:   Being able to contact the emergency services can mean the difference between life and death, so in the event of any disruption to their networks, providers must be ready to respond quickly and effectively. In this case, BT fell woefully short of its responsibilities and was ill-prepared to deal with such a large scale outage, putting its customers at unacceptable risk. Today’s fine sends a broader warning to all firms: if you’re not properly prepared to deal with disruptions to your networks, we’ll hold you to strict account on behalf of consumers.  BT, which manages the emergency services calls system, said it had taken three days to contact each of the callers who had not been connected after what it described as a complex software problem that affected nearly 14,000 call attempts from 12,392 people. Ofcom said its decision to fine BT £17.5m was based on a number of factors including the seriousness, duration and degree of harm.

The move is part of a drive to break up the media conglomerate controlled by the billionaire Vincent Bolloré to realise value from its different operations. Vivendi said the decision to list in London reflected the increasingly international operation of Canal+, which is in the process of a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) takeover of Africa’s largest pay-TV operator, Multichoice.  Vivendi said:   With close to two-thirds of its subscribers outside of France, a film and TV series distribution network present on all continents, and growth drivers resulting from its recent developments on the African, European and Asia-Pacific markets, a London-based listing would represent an attractive solution for international investors likely to be interested in the group.  Vivendi’s plan will be a welcome one after a series of setbacks for the London Stock Exchange in recent years. The most high-profile company to snub the capital was theCambridge-based chip designer Arm, one of the UK’s few bona fide global tech success stories, which chose to float on the Nasdaq in New York last year in one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years. In February, Tui, Europe’s biggest package holiday operator, moved its stock exchange listing from the FTSE 250 to Frankfurt.

Lord Harris continues to have a role on the board of Tapi, which he co-owns with about 1,000 investors, the largest of which is the executive chair, Will Barker of US investment firm Camelot Capital Partners. Tapi, which has 170 stores, said in a statement that it was “desperately sad not to have been able to save more of the business and customer orders”. Jeevan Karir, the managing director of Tapi, added:   Our goal, initially, was to try to save all of Carpetright. However, as we looked into the details of the situation, we quickly established that saving the entire business was unviable. The business has been materially loss making for a number of years and it has significant debt held by the owner.

However, he warned over a fresh bout of volatility, despite Biden’s decision to endorse his VP Kamala Harris as the potential Democrat nominee:  We could see heightened volatility over the next few weeks, with assets quickly changing direction depending on the latest comments from Washington.   Kamala Harris looks likely to be the Democratic nominee and while she might score better than Biden in the polls ahead of the election, there is still considerable uncertainty for investors to navigate as the nomination process plays out and election campaigning enters its final stage.  Gains for Bitcoin, which jumped on the prospect of a Trump win after the presidential nominee’s attempted assassination, have eased slightly on the Biden news, though it is still up around 0.8% against the US dollar. The cyptocurrency is expected to benefit from a potential unwinding of regulation under a prospective Trump presidency.  Coatsworth said:   Many investors will have looked at Trump’s ratings boost in the polls last week and placed trades on assets that could benefit if he returned to the White House. That included cryptocurrency, explaining why bitcoin has now pulled back on the news of Biden stepping down in the presidential election. The so-called ‘Trump trade’ assumed a boost for corporate profit but increased pressure on the US fiscal situation and a kicker for inflation if the former president won this year’s election. A victory also implied heightened geopolitical tension given Trump’s track record of being outspoken.      12.22pm BST  Biz secretary expects Royal Mail takeover to be called-in for government review  Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said that he expects the government to call in the proposed £3.6bn takeover of Royal Mail by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky for review . Reynolds said he will talk to Kretinsky about the bid this week, speaking to reporters at the Farnborough International Airshow.  “I think it would be reasonable to expect it to be called in,” he said, pointing to the previous review when Kretinsky first increased his shareholding. Reynolds said unions were holding talks with Kretinsky today.  He added that he would look at how he government could receive binding assurances from Kretinsky.   Fundamental to this is, what is the business plan, what does it mean for the UK’s core national interests.      12.09pm BST   The GMB union says the Harland and Wolff shipyard is “critical” to the UK’s future security.  GMB National Officer Matt Roberts said:   These are worrying times for workers and their families in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the South West. These yards have been at the heart of UK manufacturing for centuries - from building the Titanic to the ships that defeated the Armada. Now they are critical to our future security in building the Fleet Solid Support ships for our navy and in providing the renewables infrastructure needed to reach net zero. These yards must be saved and their long-term sustainable future secured.      12.06pm BST   The Labour government says it is going to hold out for a “market” saviour to rescue Harland and Wolff, business secretary Jonathan Reynolds adds.  Extended comments from Reynolds released on the parliamentary website explain:   The Government believes, in this instance, that the market is best placed to resolve the commercial matters faced by Harland and Wolff.   Harland and Wolff indicates that these discussions on new financing should conclude in the next few days. This will involve the current CEO taking an immediate leave of absence and the onboarding of new management with a focus on recapitalisation and ensuring sustainable finances.  Reynolds adds that officials will work closely with the Ministry of Defence and National National Shipbuilding Office on the fleet solid support contract, for which Harland and Wolff remains a key subcontractor:   Officials in the Ministry of Defence are also well engaged with the prime contractor, Navantia, UK to monitor delivery of this important contract. I welcome potential new financing for Harland and Wolff and the appointment of new management and wish them all the best in their continued efforts to build up this business.      12.00pm BST  UK biz secretary 'confident' that struggling shipyard Harland and Wolff will still build for Royal Navy  Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said he is confident that the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast will build ships for the Royal Navy. Harland & Wolff is part of a consortium that is due to build three naval fleet solid support ships to supply aircraft carriers.  The government has refused to grant a £200m loan guarantee to help the struggling company to refinance. The shipbuilder had hoped to secure a guarantee of up to 80% to help it avoid collapsing into administration for the second time in five years. But the guarantee would have put taxpayer money at risk if the shipyard fails.  Speaking to reporters at the Farnborough air show, Reynolds said:   It was clear that would not have been a prudent use of government money.  However, asked if he was confident that Royal Navy ships would be built in Belfast, he answered simply:   Yes.  His confidence will be a boost to the workforce in Belfast and at H&W’s other shipyards in Devon and Scotland. However, he said he expected a “market-led solution” to refinancing the company’s large debt load. The shipbuilder was forced to suspend its London-listed shares a fortnight ago, raising concerns about its future. It has missed two deadlines to file audited accounts, raising questions over its finances and its ability to fulfil a £1.6bn contract to build the three “fleet solid support” ships that will carry supplies such as ammunition and food to the navy’s aircraft carriers. The crisis is viewed as the first significant test of industrial policy for the new Labour government in London.

IAG’s CEO Luis Gallego has said – according to Reuters – that corporate travel i still recovering but that demand is strong in its core north and south Atlantic markets.  Air India’s CEO Campbell Wilson, meanwhile, has said that the international market was ‘moderating’ for th next six months, but that the domestic market was strong.      11.24am BST   More warnings about recovery time for the health sector after the CrowdStrike IT outages.  The British Medical Association (BMA) said GPs will “need time to catch up from lost work over the weekend”, adding that NHS England should “make clear to patients” this is the case. The BMA said its GP committee will continue to talk to NHS England and patient record system supplier EMIS to secure a “better system of IT back-up” to ensure the “disaster” is not repeated. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chairman of GPC England, the representative body for GPs at the BMA, said:  Friday was one of the toughest single days in recent times for GPs across England. Without a clinical IT system many were forced to return to pen and paper to be able to serve their patients. While GPs and their teams worked hard to look after as many as they could, without access to the information they needed much of the work has had to be shifted into the coming week. GPs have been pulling out all the stops this weekend to deal with the effects of Friday’s catastrophic loss of service and, as their IT systems come back online, we thank them and their staff for their hard work under exceptionally trying circumstances. We also thank patients for bearing with general practice in this unprecedented situation.      10.59am BST   Pharmacy services are expected to be “slower than usual” today as the recovery from the major global IT outage caused by the CrowdStrike update failures continues. Nick Kaye, chairman of the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), said:   As pharmacists recover from last week’s IT outage and catch up on the backlog of prescriptions, we expect service in some community pharmacies to be slower than usual today. Please be patient with your local pharmacy team if you are visiting them, as they may still be prioritising emergency prescriptions from their local GP surgeries as well as experiencing increased demand as services return to normal. As ever, community pharmacies have worked hard to provide support for those who need them during this period.      10.52am BST   Commenting on the global travel chaos caused by the CrowdStrike IT failures, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said the airline had 400 cancellations this weekend, mainly due to the fallout from Friday’s IT issues.      10.33am BST   The UK government will need to raise taxes, increase borrowing or make spending cuts unless it can grow the economy by at least three times this year’s expected rate, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. Economic growth would need to be around 2.6% in each year of parliament from next April before Labour can claim to have stabilised the public finances.  That is well above the rate of growth predicted by the IMF. Last month the IMF predicted the UK economy will grow by 0.9% in the current financial year, ending in April 2025. That is projected to rise to around 1.6% or 1.7% in the remaining years of this parliament. The calculations showed that the UK budget balance excluding interest payments will need to improve by between 0.8 and 1.4 percentage points of GDP per year to get debt under control. In analysis for the Financial Times (paywall), IMF staff estimates show the acceleration in economic growth needed to avoid tough choices will necessitate a return to the expansionary period seen before the financial crash of 2008. A Treasury spokesperson told the FT that the government was “under no illusions” about the scale of the challenge facing the economy.  Delivering economic growth will require tough choices and difficult decisions. That is why we have already started to take the action necessary to fix the foundations of our economy, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.      10.24am BST  Ryanair CEO: Consumers resistant to price hikes  The Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has told analysts this morning that the airline is repeatedly seeing resistance from customers when they have tried to put up prices for flights.  And that is unlikely to change anytime soon, with O’Leary adding that the trend is ‘downwards, not upwards’ and that they see no reason why prices in Q3 and Q4 won’t be soft as well.  This could result in Ryanair boss said this could result in double digit percentage falls in fares, and that, at minimum, it could mean a 5% drop year-on-year in the second quarter.  But O’Leary speculated over whether this year could actually be part of a ‘rebalancing’ after double-digit fare increases in recent year.  He added that the airline will aggressively advertise the availability of low-price fares.      10.08am BST   Begbies Traynor data also showed that around 40,613 UK businesses are in “critical” financial distress, up 1.1% on the prior quarter and 34.5% higher than a year earlier: Top 10 Sector Ranking – Critical Financial Distress  Construction 6,043 Support Services 5,758 Real Estate & Property Services 5,575 General Retailers 3,113 Professional Services 2,770 Health & Education 2,436 Telecommunications & Information Technology 2,256 Food & Drug Retailers 1,696 Bars & Restaurants 1,587  Media 1,467  There are concerns concerns about the continued impact of high interest rates – for both consumers and businesses – even with the prospect of near-term rate cuts. Palmer said:  Additionally, the situation for the consumer remains very precarious. The latest figures from the Bank of England highlights how more than three million households will come off their fixed rate mortgages over the next two years – resulting in substantially higher repayments for many – which will in turn act as a drag on disposable incomes. In a climate like this one, many businesses who were supported through the pandemic and its aftershocks by the government, will be hugely concerned by the very real prospect of a prolonged period of higher interest rates. Many businesses who loaded up on cheap debt prior to the pandemic are simply not equipped to survive the current pressures and the financial burdens they face may ultimately prove too much.      10.06am BST  Data: 10% jump in UK businesses in 'significant' distress  The number of UK companies in “significant” financial distress jumped by nearly 10% in the second quarter, according to Begbies Traynor. It comes as weak demand from cost-conscious consumers and more expensive debt repayments hit businesses. Newly-released data from one of the UK’s biggest insolvency practitioners the number of businesses facing significant distress rose to 601,950 from 554,554 in the first quarter, with increases in 20 of 22 sectors. The change was even more stark year-on-year, up 36.9% from the same period in 2023. It reveals a particularly worrying picture of British corporate health, with a marked acceleration in leisure sectors quarter-on-quarter, including:  Travel & Tourism (+20.1%), Hotels & Accommodation (+16.4%) Bars & Restaurants (+12.2%)  Those business have been by weak confidence amongst consumers still struggling financially from the impacts of the cost of living crisis. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said:  It looks like 2024 will prove to be another tough year for UK businesses. Six months in, and we’re seeing clear signs that financial distress is growing across almost every sector. It is a particularly difficult situation for businesses in consumer facing sectors, such as hospitality. While a fall in inflation to more palatable levels will likely provide some relief, consumers simply aren’t behaving like they used to and these businesses, who are still grappling with higher costs pushed up by higher wages, are really struggling. This, combined with one of the wettest summers on record, continues to significantly impact trading.   Updated at 11.11am BST    9.14am BST   Full story: Ryanair has said its profits plunged by almost half between April and June and warned that fares this summer would be “materially lower” than last year. Europe’s largest airline reported profits of €360m (£303m) in the spring quarter, 46% lower than the same period last year, despite passenger numbers rising 10% to 55.5 million. The downbeat results, which missed analysts’ estimates, drove the budget carrier’s share price down 12.5% in early trading on Monday. The news also affected other publicly traded airline stocks. EasyJet fell 7.5%, Wizz Air was down 6.3% and IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, slipped 3.3%. The average cost of a fare dropped from €49.07 to €41.93 year on year, but the increase in passenger numbers helped limit the decline in total revenues to 1% at €363bn. Ryanair said while it expected strong demand this summer, with passenger numbers likely to be up 8% overall this financial year, “pricing remains softer than we expected”:  We now expect second-quarter fares [July to September] to be materially lower than last summer…The final first-half outcome is, however, totally dependent on close-in bookings and yields in August and September.  “Close-in bookings” refer to customers waiting much longer than usual to book summer flights.

Shares were bolstered after US grocer Kroger placed an order for a wide range of new automated technologies to roll out in warehouses across its network.  While the company did not put a value on the Kroger order, it said it would be using the tech in both current and future warehouses, suggesting a boost to future revenues.  It comes a week after Ocado raised its annual guidance for its technology arm. The company said it expects its tech division to achieve a “mid-teens” Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin this year, up from previous guidance of more than 10%.  CEO Tim Steiner said last week that the global shift to online shopping had resumed, after a brief post-pandemic pause: “We expect to see a lot of long-term growth.”     8.35am BST   A view of those Ryanair shares, which are getting hammered after the airline’s earnings results:  Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says there will be knock-on effects to the wider sector, as investors speculate whether rivals are feeling similar pressures:   Ryanair disappoints as the outlook over the key summer period looks weak First quarter profit after tax of €360mn was well below what markets expected as ticket prices plummeted.  The outlook was poor, too, with Ryanair expecting lower prices as peak summer travel kicks in.  There will be knock-on effects to the wider sector from this, though it’s a little unclear whether the likes of easyJet are facing issues at quite this scale.      8.27am BST  Ryanair shares tumble 12.5% at start of trading  Disappointing Ryanair profits – and its warnings over depressed summer airfares – has knocked back its shares 12.5% at the start of trading. The airline’s disappointing update has also managed to drag down rivals, including British Airways owners IAG, which is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index, down 3.3% . But even worse-hit is EasyJet which is down more than 7% and is now at the bottom of the bluechip index.

The world is still recovering from the global IT outage caused by a faulty security update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike last week, which hit hospitals, businesses, banks and airline services around the world.  In LinkedIn post overnight, CrowdStrike said it was continuing to “focus on restoring all systems as soon as possible,” and that it had deployed a “new technique” to try get everyone back online.:   CrowdStrike continues to focus on restoring all systems as soon as possible. Of the approximately 8.5 million Windows devices that were impacted, a significant number are back online and operational.Together with customers, we tested a new technique to accelerate impacted system remediation. We’re in the process of operationalizing an opt-in to this technique. We’re making progress by the minute.  While the company has again apologised for the disruption, full restoration could take weeks. And that may result in further pain for CrowdStrike’s US-listed shares, which have so far plunged 11%.  Meanwhile, Ryanair has suffered a 46% drop in its first quarter profits, covering the three months to June, after the airline was hit by cost-conscious travellers.  Average passenger fares fell 15% in the quarter, compared to a year earlier, with CEO Michael O’Leary explaining that they had to take part in “more price stimulation than we had previously expected – meaning the the airline had to cut prices to bolster demand.” He said the airline had recently tried to close off some cheap seats but they were met with resistance, and opened up lower-cost seats again, as a result.  O’Leary warned that there was likely to be more pain the second quarter:   While Q2 demand is strong, pricing remains softer than we expected, and we now expect Q2 fares to be materially lower than last summer.

      "The property firm Hammerson has sold its stake in the group that controls Bicester Village, the cut-price designer goods shopping centre in Oxfordshire, to the luxury market investor L Catterton in a £1.5bn deal. Hammerson said it would raise £600m in cash proceeds from the sale of its near-40% stake in Value Retail, which also owns nine luxury shopping destinations near Barcelona, Brussels, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, Milan and Munich. The property company plans to use the cash to pay down debt, invest in its other centres and return £140m to shareholders. L Catterton, a private equity firm part-owned by the Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior owner LVMH, said: “With its high-quality portfolio, reputation for luxury and commitment to delivering a distinctive experience to customers, Value Retail is well positioned for growth and continued success.”   Related: Carpetright brand and 54 stores bought by rival, saving 300 jobs   Rita-Rose Gagné, the chief executive of Hammerson, which owns a string of shopping centres including Birmingham’s Bull Ring and Cabot Circus in Bristol, said: “This is a transformational deal for Hammerson, generating cash proceeds of [about] £600m whilst removing an overweight, low-yielding and minority stake, and positioning us for accelerated growth and value creation.” She said the deal helped to focus Hammerson’s portfolio on “prime urban real estate” and to concentrate on “higher-yielding opportunities with stronger returns, whilst enhancing returns to shareholders”. The sale marks Hammerson’s latest disposal as it tries to reinvigorate its portfolio amid rapidly changing shopping habits. Gagné has sold off assets to focus investment on Hammerson’s urban shopping centres where it is repurposing redundant department stores space into a mix of food, leisure, services, shopping and residential developments. Visitor numbers at shopping centres have come under pressure as a string of department stores have closed, including the collapse of Debenhams and Beales and closures by House of Fraser, John Lewis and Marks & Spencer. Shopping centres are also facing heavy competition from online retailers and smaller, outdoor retail parks. Hammerson sold its 50% stake in its Croydon shopping centre redevelopment joint venture to its partner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield at the end of April. Last year it sold its stake in the Parisian shopping centre Italie Deux and an adjacent site to the owner of Ikea.\n",
      "BT has been fined more than £17m for missing 14,000 emergency calls after technical faults caused the emergency call handling service to be disrupted for nearly 11 hours last summer. The telecoms regulator launched an investigation shortly after the incident on 25 June 2023. Publishing its findings on Monday, Ofcom said the handling of the network fault was a “catastrophic failure”. The watchdog’s director of enforcement, Suzanne Cater, said: “Being able to contact the emergency services can mean the difference between life and death, so in the event of any disruption to their networks, providers must be ready to respond quickly and effectively. “In this case, BT fell woefully short of its responsibilities and was ill-prepared to deal with such a large scale outage, putting its customers at unacceptable risk.   Related: Ofcom to ban inflation-linked mid-contract price rises on phones, pay-TV and broadband   “Today’s fine sends a broader warning to all firms: if you’re not properly prepared to deal with disruptions to your networks, we’ll hold you to strict account on behalf of consumers.” BT, which manages the emergency services calls system, said it had taken three days to contact each of the callers who had not been connected after what it described as a complex software problem that affected nearly 14,000 call attempts from 12,392 people. “Being able to contact the emergency services can mean the difference between life and death,” Cater said. “So in the event of any disruption to their networks, providers must be ready to respond quickly and effectively.” Ofcom said its decision to fine BT £17.5m was based on a number of factors including the seriousness, duration and degree of harm. The regulator found BT had neither sufficient warning systems in place for this kind of incident nor adequate procedures for quickly assessing the severity, impact and likely cause of such a software failure. It also found the telecoms company’s disaster recovery platform had insufficient capacity and functionality to deal with a level of demand that might be reasonably expected. “Although there have been no confirmed reports by the emergency authorities of serious harm to members of the public as a result of the incident, the potential degree of harm was extremely significant,” Ofcom said. BT apologised for the technical failure, saying it takes “great pride” running the 999 service and had fallen “short of our own high standards” in this case. A BT spokesperson said: “The level of disruption to the service on Sunday 25 June last year has never been seen before and we are sincerely sorry for the distress caused. “While no technology is 100% resilient, we have built a highly robust network with multiple layers of protection to connect the public to blue light services in their time of need. We take our responsibility to the emergency services and the public seriously, and on this occasion we fell short of our own high standards for the 999 service.”\n",
      "John Lewis customers will be able to give their favourite leather jacket a new lease of life or have a cushion cover fixed, as part of a repairs partnership with Timpson Group, the business famed for offering ex-offenders a second chance. The service, which will be trialled at five stores from Monday, is designed to encourage shoppers to pay to have items altered, repaired, cleaned or restored, rather than throwing them away and buying replacements. Extending a garment’s life by nine months can reduce its carbon, waste and water footprints by up to 30%, according to Wrap, a charity that supports the circular economy. The cheapest repair on offer at John Lewis will cost £10.95, for “minor” rips and tears, or fitting a new half-pocket. For £28.50, a broken zip on a cushion cover can be fixed. At the more expensive end, customers can pay £99.95 to have a handbag restored. Items from any brand can be fixed through the service. The 16-week trial, at John Lewis’s Oxford, Liverpool, Cheadle, Milton Keynes and Welwyn branches, is a collaboration with Johnsons, the 200-year-old dry-cleaning company. Johnsons is part of Timpson Group, which is known for its eponymous key-cutting and shoe-mending business and owns brands including the photo chain Snappy Snaps. The group has a long record of employing former prison inmates, who make up more than 10% of its workforce, about 1,200 ex-offenders in total. This led to its chief executive, James Timpson, being named Keir Starmer’s new minister for prisons shortly after Labour’s landslide election victory earlier this month. John Lewis and Timpson highlighted the environmental benefit of mending clothes and household items rather than replacing them. Will Lankston, the managing director of Timpson Direct, said: “Alterations have always been one of the core parts of our business and we have been seeing this increase over the past few years as more customers are conscious about the environment and are wanting to repair and bring back to life some of their well-loved garments and accessories.”  John Lewis said the trial would show it which customers wanted to use the service and what they wanted from it, such as the type of garments most commonly brought in for repair.\n",
      "Before the age of 20, Donat Rétif had never set foot in a plane: his world was confined to the quiet southern Belgian mining region he called home, and neighbouring France. A year studying in Quebec as part of his business degree would prove the precursor to a globe­trotting career, culminating in landing the top job at loveholidays, the online travel agent responsible for millions of travellers taking to the skies each year. “I had a very simple upbringing. Canada was a big opening for me; I wanted to discover the world,” he says. This weekend, the pressure ramps up as many schools in England and Wales break up for the holidays. Rétif has led the business since late 2019, taking charge after meeting its founders, Jonny Marsh and Alex Francis, who had set up the company in 2012. “We agreed on point A and point Z – where we were and wanted to be. My skills are to take businesses and grow them,” he says. So far, the indicators are positive. The company has overtaken some rival online travel agents, including London-listed On the Beach, and is fighting it out for market share with package operators such as Tui and Jet2, which he says have a different model as they own physical assets, from hotels to planes. Rétif’s goal is to become the largest online travel specialist in Europe, using agile tech and new markets to expand. This year, he forecasts passenger numbers will hit nearly 5 million across the UK and Ireland, up from 1 million in 2019. Revenues reached £235m in 2023, up by £100m on the previous year, while pre-tax profits rose from £30m to £55m, despite pressure on the balance sheet from rising interest rates and a hit from wildfires in Greece. The fires devastated Rhodes – leaving the tourism ministry offering compensation for holidaymakers forced to flee the island – and cost the company nearly £1m to get customers home safely and cover cancellations resulting from hotel shutdowns. However, Rétif believes his business is well placed to react swiftly to extreme events. “We don’t have exclusivity [on hotels] – we’re not pushing people to go to one place because we make more money. They can easily change from one [destination] to another,” he says. “We do not own any assets. We don’t own hotels. We don’t own planes, which gives us this flexibility and agility to basically bounce back very quickly when there’s a crisis.” He praises loveholidays’ web tools, which mean it can respond quickly to consumer concerns, whether over global heating or overtourism in places such as Dubrovnik and the Canary Islands. “When we realise that people care about an issue like this, we add filters. If there’s something our customers demand, we will offer it.”   Countries were closing, triple-testing – there were a lot of uncertainties, especially in the UK  Donat Rétif on Covid    Rétif’s tech-y take on the travel industry reflects the path of his career. After his studies, he started in telecoms, including a spell with global behemoth Verizon, taking on jobs in Europe and Canada and on America’s west coast. The Californian economy took a hit after 9/11, and then his father’s illness brought him back to Belgium, where he took a role digitising an international equivalent of the Yellow Pages. Three years managing a team of meteorologists as the boss of weather analysis business MeteoGroup followed, before his switch into the travel industry. Rétif has had to navigate several other hurdles since taking charge, from the recent collapse of Germany’s FTI – Europe’s third-largest tour operator – which affected 31,000 of his customers, to the cost of living crisis and, crucially, Covid. The pandemic grounded flights and imposed lengthy restrictions on the travel industry, leaving Rétif scrambling to hang on to his workforce of young, sought-after tech engineers – and battling complaints over refunds, as airlines refused to pay out money owed to travel agents. “Countries were closing, triple-testing – there were a lot of uncertainties, especially in the UK,” he says. Against this backdrop, he raised £94m across two funding rounds and hung on to loveholidays’ staff, tripling the workforce to more than 350. Last Christmas, he put previous pandemic-fuelled tensions with Ryanair aside – agreeing the budget carrier’s first partnership with an online travel agent. A recent expansion drive in Germany will be followed by an imminent launch in Austria, and possibly the Netherlands or Poland. Loveholidays has been backed by the private equity firm Livingbridge since 2018, and last year it was reported that bankers were working on a sale that could value the business at £1bn. “I don’t know at this stage,” says Rétif. “The only thing you do as the CEO is control the mission, the vision and operations of your business.” Even if it does change hands, “nothing’s going to change”, he insists. But taking charge of people’s holidays is a significant responsibility, and the public do not hold back if anything goes awry. How many one-star Trustpilot reviews has loveholidays received in the 48 hours before our interview, the Observer asks. “Five?” Rétif guesses. In fact, it’s 29. (For balance, it also had more than 100 five-star reviews, and has an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5.) The complaints are fairly standard: airport transfers that didn’t show up, slow refunds, hotels shut after late flights – but a repeated issue is poor communication. Loveholidays “have a firewall of ill-informed, ill-prepared staff. It is impossible to reach anyone with any authority,” one irate reviewer wrote. “When you send 5 million passengers abroad, you will always have some who are unhappy,” Rétif responds. “If you told me I had zero, I would have given you a kiss and asked: ‘How did you manage [not] to find it?’ I usually receive those very difficult ones [directly]; we always try to find a solution.” The firm has invested £13m a year in customer service, and 55% of requests are resolved by an AI chatbot, he says.

      "I’m due a haircut and in the past week received a message from my barber containing the news that the price will be 10% higher than the last time I went for a trim. If I call in for a coffee on my way to work it will be a similar story. After recent price rises, I can expect to pay the thick end of £4 for a flat white. These are two examples of what Rachel Reeves calls the everyday economy in action, and they tell us something about the challenge facing the chancellor as she seeks to improve the UK’s poor economic performance. It’s not hard to see why a haircut and a cup of coffee are going up in price. Rents are higher, insurance is more expensive and so are fuel and labour. Businesses have a choice: they can either absorb these extra costs themselves or they can try to pass them on to their customers. Many are doing the latter, which is why inflation in the services sector is running at 5.7% while overall inflation is at 2%. This matters. These days, the UK is primarily a service-sector economy. Manufacturing and construction are still important, but services account for about 80% of national output. Prices have risen by about 20% in the past three years and labour shortages have made it harder for employers to resist pressure for higher pay to compensate. Much of the service sector is labour-intensive and, unsurprisingly, workers don’t want to see their living standards eroded. The very nature of the service sector makes productivity improvements hard to chisel out. My haircut takes as long as it did a year ago; the flat white comes in the same-sized cup and tastes the same. As a customer, I am getting the same service but paying more for it. As a nation, output per worker is up by 1.5% in the four years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; in the public sector – where Reeves is contemplating above-inflation pay awards this year – productivity is 6% lower. Productivity is easy to measure in a car factory but harder to assess in the NHS. If a GP spends five minutes more per patient but by doing so saves lives does that count as productivity loss, because of the extra time spent, or (as it should) a productivity gain? Similarly, a restaurant meal might take as long to produce as it did a year ago but be of a higher quality. If this means the customers have a better time than they did before then that’s a productivity improvement in any meaningful sense of the term. But time-wise, it’s no better. Nor is it impossible to think of ways in which technology has helped to boost service-sector productivity. Checking a fact or referring to a previously written article meant a visit to the cuttings’ library when I started as a journalist many moons ago. Now search engines make the process quicker and simpler. Even so, the fact that the UK is a labour-intensive service-sector economy has made the Bank of England warier about cutting interest rates than it might otherwise have been. A blog on Threadneedle Street’s Bank Underground site by a staff member, Tomas Key, found that trend (underlying) wage growth is currently 6%, double its pre-pandemic level. This raises two questions. The first is whether higher wage growth is merely a response to higher inflation and will come down now that prices are rising less quickly. That appears to be the case. The annual growth in average earnings was 5.1% in the year to May compared with 8.2% in the same month of 2023. The second is whether the Bank can do much to bring down wage growth, short of keeping interest rates at a punitive enough level to cause economic distress. The answer is no, not really. Higher interest rates are a crude tool that work by making businesses too nervous to risk raising prices and by forcing workers to accept below-inflation pay increases through the fear of losing their jobs. So far, the evidence is that the economy has withstood a year of interest rates at 5.25% much better than might have been expected. There was a short, shallow, technical recession in the second half of 2023 but activity is now gently recovering. It would be doing so more quickly were it not for the 14 increases in official borrowing costs between December 2021 and August 2023. All that said, the answer to Britain’s productivity weakness does not lie with the Bank of England. Instead, it will depend on changes to the supply side of the economy. Reeves will chair the first meeting of the Treasury’s new growth mission board on Tuesday. Higher levels of private and public investment would help boost productivity and growth. If manufacturing represented a bigger share of national output that would help too because there is more scope for labour-saving efficiencies in a factory than in a care home. Productivity growth would be faster were Britain’s industrial base bigger. AI has the potential to be an a gamechanger, because it will have an impact on all sectors of the economy and not just manufacturing. Indeed, there is already evidence of that happening. Labour is unsure how to regulate AI but if it wants faster productivity growth then AI is going to be an important part of the mix. Even then, though, it is important to be realistic. Britain is going to remain predominantly a service-sector economy and there are services that do not readily lend themselves to productivity gains. A robot cutting my hair? I don’t think so.\n",
      "The residents of Farnborough, Hampshire, are constantly disturbed by flights to and from the UK’s busiest airport for private jets. But for one week in July every two years, the whine of commercial aircraft is replaced by the bone-juddering roar of fighter planes. The occasion is the Farnborough international airshow, a gathering of top executives from airlines, aircraft makers and arms manufacturers hoping to sell their wares and press flesh. Two years ago, the aerospace and defence industry was starting to emerge from the turmoil of the pandemic. For many of the attendees this week, the question will be less about whether there is demand for their products and more about whether they are able to make them fast enough. “The supply chain was supposed to be acute in 2022 and better by now,” says Nick Cunningham, an aerospace and defence equity analyst at Agency Partners. But that has not panned out as expected.  The International Civil Aviation Organization forecasts that global air travel could triple by 2050. Without technological improvements, that would mean carbon dioxide emissions rising from about 500m tonnes to more than 1.5bn tonnes. The question of how to eliminate those carbon emissions is always the shadow hanging over airshows (particularly in 2022 during a record English heatwave), but that has not stopped Europe’s Airbus and America’s Boeing from racing to pile up orders from airlines. Airbus had a backlog of 8,626 orders to get through at the end of last year, but Boeing has only 5,600. That reflects the latter’s lurch from crisis to crisis since two crashes of its bestselling 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people. Boeing’s latest disaster – thankfully with no loss of life – was a door panel blowing out during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The US plane maker this month pleaded guilty to criminal charges of violating a plea deal related to the 737 Max crashes. A strong airshow order book may help the company restart its turnaround efforts again. The crisis has made Airbus the clear industry leader and at the show it will fly an A321XLR. The demand for the passenger jet’s “extra long range” has put immense pressure on Boeing to respond. Yet Airbus is struggling to press home its advantage. The new variant was delayed by a year and last month the company cut its forecast for the number of planes it will make this year from 800 to 770, as it struggles to source engines, seats and parts for aircraft cabins. Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, says “supply chain and other issues have continued to hold up new aircraft deliveries and cloud the outlook”. The “narrative of gradual improvement” , he adds, has been replaced by doubts over the ability to accelerate manufacturing.   Executives will want to know if the newly announced strategic defence review will mean a delay to orders in the pipeline   On the defence side, Farnborough is a handy shop window for companies hoping to sell to the UK government. The town itself – part of the constituency of Aldershot – is evidence of the change on that front: the home of a large British army garrison was Conservative for more than a century, before turning Labour at the general election. Francis Tusa, editor of the Defence Analysis newsletter, says then Tory prime minister David Cameron was “mobbed” when he opened the show in 2012, as bosses tried to work out the government’s thinking. He said it is likely to be a similar situation for Labour’s new defence ministers, among them John Healey, Vernon Coaker and Maria Eagle, who are expected to attend – possibly alongside Keir Starmer. Executives will want to know if the newly announced strategic defence review will mean a delay to orders in the pipeline.  The grim increase in wars in recent years has been a bonanza for arms manufacturers. The market values of UK weapons companies Babcock, BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce are up by 60%, 64% and nearly 400% respectively since the last Farnborough airshow. The global aerospace and defence industry made record revenues of $829bn in 2023 as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza helped to increase military budgets. Cunningham says government weapons plans suggest an “upturn on the scale and duration of the prewar rearmament” before the second world war. Yet for all the defence industry demand, manufacturers may have to answer some of the same pointed questions about whether they are ready. After the pandemic, “defence didn’t suffer that extreme initial impact of the supply chain that we saw in civil,” says Cunningham. But there are signs it may be coming, he adds: “We’ve just not seen any of it yet.”\n",
      "Labour has promised to bring forward wide-ranging reforms of the £2tn private pensions industry in a review that aims “to boost investment, increase pension pots and tackle waste in the pensions system”. A taskforce of industry executives and ministers from the Treasury and department of work and pensions will propose ways to cut costs and improve investment options, allowing retirement scheme managers to boost pension pots by up to £11,000. The taskforce will also consider making it easier for pension funds to broaden their investment strategies to include a larger slice of UK businesses. The move follows the announcement of a pensions bill in the king’s speech this month, which critics said failed to signal an ambitious overhaul of the industry. Rachel Reeves said the review is part of “a big bang of reforms” that includes a £7bn national wealth fund and planning reforms to unlock the UK’s potential growth. The chancellor added: “There is no time to waste. That is why I am determined to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and improve people’s lives.” With a first draft of the review expected before Reeves’s first budget in the autumn, new rules could be in place as soon as next year. One aim of the taskforce is to pave the way for a merger of the 87 individual pension schemes in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) covering England and Wales. The scheme, which ranks as the seventh largest pension fund in the world, managing £360bn worth of assets, spends £2bn on fees, which could be reduced following a formal merger. Pooling the assets in the LGPS would enable the funds to be invested in a wider range of UK assets. The review will be led by pensions minister Emma Reynolds, who has a joint role across the DWP and the Treasury. Reynolds said: “As the first ever joint Treasury and DWP minister, I am uniquely placed to tackle the twin challenges of productive investment and retirement outcomes. “Over the next few months the review will focus on identifying any further actions to drive investment that could be taken forward in the pension schemes bill, before then exploring long-term challenges to ensure our pensions system is fit for the future.”   Related: Pension reform is the key to unleashing investment boom and turning round stock market   Reynolds will aim to reverse a decades-old trend in which billions of pounds of UK savings have been invested abroad. The US stock market has surged fivefold over the past 30 years while shares on the London exchange have largely moved sideways. Fund managers have also sought to invest in fast-growing companies in the Far East to satisfy their commitments to UK pension savers. Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of M&G, one of the UK’s largest fund managers, welcomed the review, saying it is long overdue. He said the firm has “a rich heritage of investing in the UK” and there are “significant opportunities ahead to give the real economy a boost over the next decade and beyond”. Reeves said the government would consider legislating to mandate pooling LGPS assets if insufficient progress is made by March 2025.\n",
      "The election campaign mantra of “change, change, change” reminded me of those people down on their luck who approach you in the street and ask “got any change, guv?” Until this month’s welcome result in the polling booths, the Labour party had certainly been down on its luck. From the moment in 2010 when the new chancellor, George Osborne, capitalised on departing Labour chief secretary Liam Byrne’s joke that “there’s no money left”, Labour was fighting an uphill battle. It was a joke. There was a tradition in the Treasury that such greetings were left for the succeeding government, but that it was “not cricket” for political capital to be made out of them. Not, that is, until the advent of Chancellor Osborne and the coalition chief secretary David Laws, who had found his predecessor’s joke in his in-tray.  In 1964, the departing Tory chancellor, Reginald Maudling, quipped to the incoming chancellor, James Callaghan, “sorry to leave it in such a mess, old cock”, but Callaghan did not make a meal out of this and the story only emerged years later. In 2010, there was plenty of money available out there, although the repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis did not make things easy. But, in a thoroughly misleading way, Osborne blamed Labour’s putative overspending for the crisis, whereas – as the senior official at the Treasury, Nicholas (now Lord) Macpherson, pointed out – “it was a banking crisis, pure and simple.”  Osborne used the fantasy that there was no money left to introduce austerity, whose damaging impact was one of the factors that contributed to the protest vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum – and, eight years later, to the resounding defeat of the party that had foolishly called it. But back to the all-change mantra. Much as I try to manifest goodwill towards Starmer and his iron chancellor, Rachel Reeves, when I look at their rigid adherence to the previous government’s fiscal rules and public spending plans, I do not see much sign of change, change, change. Frankly, I think a Labour government that has a huge majority and is in an enviably powerful position is making a huge mistake in not capitalising on its freedom and the manifest goodwill that has greeted it from the majority of voters, as well as business and finance.   Kenneth Clarke famously said that, had the Conservatives been re-elected in 1997, he would certainly not have stuck to his own spending plans   Reeves spends as much time reminding us that she worked at the Bank of England as Starmer does telling us his father was a toolmaker. Someone else who worked at the Bank is Andy Haldane, the former chief economist there and now chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts. Haldane takes a more refreshing view than Reeves of the so-called fiscal restraints. In an article in the Financial Times in May, he said of the fiscal rules: “By constraining investment and stunting growth, these are self-defeating … they need to be replaced with rules that prioritise growth and seek to maximise national net worth, not minimise gross debt.”  Of course, the other election mantra that accompanied change, change, change was growth, growth, growth. But without a more positive fiscal policy, and a boost to trade from rejoining the single market, it is not obvious that there will be a boost to growth. Starmer and Reeves keep calling for such a boost. But I am reminded of that great exchange in Henry IV, Part One: Glendower: “I can call spirits from the vasty deep.” Hotspur: “Why, so can I, and so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?”  Another, connected, sphere in which I worry that the new government is being timid is in the lame way it has accepted the Sunak-Hunt spending plans. This is reminiscent of the way Gordon Brown accepted Conservative chancellor Kenneth Clarke’s spending plans in 1997. Clarke laughed at this and famously said that, had the Conservatives been re-elected, he would certainly not have stuck to his own plans.  One of our new crop of Labour ministers’ distinguished predecessors was Harold Lever, who served as financial brain to the Wilson/Callaghan governments of 1974-79. He had a favourite phrase when expressing his views on the approach to economic policy of his colleagues: they were, he declared, “frolicking in the margins”.  Both with regard to fiscal rules and our relations with the EU, it seems to me the new government is indeed frolicking in the margins. It is certainly good news that Starmer is trying to “reset” our relationship with our former EU partners. But, while welcome, the various ways in which he is seeking to mitigate the economic harm of Brexit are relatively minor by comparison with the continuing, and mounting, damage being wrought by our exclusion from the EU. In the words of Mike Galsworthy, chair of European Movement UK, the latest IMF forecasts confirm that leaving the EU “has drained the life out of the British economy”.\n",
      "Dogs and cats in the UK are expected to become the first in Europe to be given cultivated meat, a product grown from chicken cells in the laboratory. The pet food promises to alleviate some of the ethical and environmental dilemmas faced by animal lovers. An array of lab-grown dishes, from “cell coffee” to lab-grown oyster meat, could be coming to human plates in the near future. Meat Since the world’s first lab-grown burger, with a price tag of £215,000, was unveiled a decade ago there has been a rush of venture capital investment into cultivated meat startups and McKinsey has predicted a global valuation for the industry of $25bn (£19.3bn) by 2030. Making meat in a lab involves taking a biopsy of animal muscle or fat stem cells and multiplying them indefinitely in a broth of nutrients. The matured cells are then seeded into a 3D scaffold to make a solid piece of meat. The first flurry of products – chicken nuggets and beef steaks – have already been approved in the US, Singapore and Israel, but price remains an issue. A scotch egg with lab-grown meat, created by Fortnum and Mason, is said to have a cost tens of pounds to produce. It is unclear whether many consumers – particularly meat lovers – will pay prices equivalent to a high-end steak for something that tastes closer to a turkey twizzler. Another challenge has been phasing out the use of foetal bovine serum, blood extracted in a grisly process at the slaughterhouse, which is an ideal nutrient for cells but undermines a central ethical argument for lab-grown meat. There has been progress on this and some of the recently approved products involved lab methods that avoided the use of serum. “The scale up of cultivated meat technology as a sustainable alternative to current meat production remains a major challenge for the industry,” said Prof David Kaplan, director of a $10m centre for cell-cultivated meat at Tufts University. “There is great optimism on this path, as over the past 10 years the costs for the process have been reduced by orders of magnitude as research and development have progressed.” Fish Overfishing is an escalating problem, with a recent report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimating there is a 28m-tonne gap between the demand for seafood and sources of supply. Plastic and heavy metal contamination have also become food safety concerns. A €7m (£6m) EU research project, Fostering European Cellular Agriculture for Sustainable Transition Solutions (Feasts), is aiming to develop cell lines for the production of salmon, sea bass, oysters and other seafood products. A focus is improving efficiency – the equivalent of an elite breeding programme – by identifying cells that efficiently produce muscle and fat and with desired nutritional properties. “Genetics does matter,” said Dr Frederico Castelo Ferreira, of the University of Lisbon, who is coordinating the EU-funded project and runs a startup developing the first cultivated octopus product. “There are some variants that have more muscle, this is valid not only for cows but for fish.” Coffee, chocolate and exotic fruits Coffee and cocoa farming have substantial environmental impacts beyond their carbon footprint, including water use, deforestation and biodiversity loss. Extreme weather conditions have also lead to drastic reductions in supply, with the cost of cocoa doubling in months at the start of this year and one analysis estimating that half of the land used to grow coffee could be unproductive by 2050 due to the climate crisis. “If you think of coffee or cocoa, there are big challenges even to grow them,” said Dr Emilia Nordlund, of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. “If we want to have these products in future, it might be that we’re not able to cultivate them.” VTT, a state-owned company, is focused on lab-grown plant products, including coffee, cocoa and exotic berries with potential medicinal properties. “These are luxurious products that we don’t need to survive, but it’s nice to have coffee and chocolate,” Nordlund said. “We’re not trying to replace wheat and corn or staple food products.” The cultivation process is quicker and simpler than for animal cells, taking a week or two rather than several weeks. There is no need to replicate any complex textures with coffee but questions remain about whether one problem is being replaced with another: the cells need to be fed with sugar, presumably grown in a field, and the claimed environmental benefits depend on whether the renewable electricity is used to power the bioreactors. The lab has succeeded in producing cell coffee, which is harvested as a “uniform cell mass”, dried out to produce a powder and roasted to turn it brown. Nordlund is yet to sample the coffee herself, but a professional sensory panel gave their verdict earlier in the year: “It was not the best coffee, maybe, but there were notes of coffee and the caffeine was there,” she said. Milk There is already a massive market for plant-based milk, with the dairy alternatives worth £2.5bn in western Europe in 2020-21, according to Euromonitor. A new wave of companies are looking to expand the alternative dairy market even further, with lab-grown dairy products. Many of these aim to reproduce milk components like whey and casein by inserting the genetic code for various milk proteins into bacteria. The bacteria are fermented and churn out bio-identical versions of these proteins. One Silicon Valley startup, Perfect Day, is using this approach to produce milk, yoghurt, cream cheese, and ice-cream. Other companies are taking things one step further and aiming to cultivate milk-producing cells taken from mammals to turn liquid directly into milk. The Israel-based company Wilk, which has investment from Danone, is producing human and cow milk using this approach.\n",
      "Len Blavatnik, the second-richest man in Britain, is facing a series of protests in the UK after his Israeli television channel was accused of cancelling programmes to please Benjamin Netanyahu. Aviel Lewis, a London-based Israeli who is part of the anti-Netanyahu WeDemocracy group, said Blavatnik was known in the UK “as a patron of progressive culture and arts” and the British public was not aware that he was also involved in “something that is clearly taking Israeli media years back and corrupting it”. Lewis is part of a group of Israeli citizens opposed to the Netanyahu government who are planning to hold protests on Sunday at the Tate Modern’s Blavatnik wing and the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of government. Other cultural institutions featuring the Blavatnik name could later be targeted, with the protesters arguing that the billionaire’s media company is undermining freedom of the press in Israel. Lewis said the oligarch should realise the potential risk to his reputation in the UK: “We want to make Mr Blavatnik feel uncomfortable.” Blavatnik received a knighthood in recognition of his donations to British institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Courtauld Institute of Art and the National Portrait Gallery. He also controls a wide range of businesses including Warner Music – home to Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, and Megan Thee Stallion – as well as sports streaming company DAZN and London’s Theatre Royal Haymarket. In Israel he owns a majority stake in Channel 13 News, a broadcaster that was known for being a thorn in the side of the Netanyahu government. It had been one of the few Israeli media outlets to air commentary openly critical of Netanyahu and the conduct of Israel’s war in Gaza. Channel 13 News’ board last month appointed Yulia Shamalov-Berkovich, a former politician seen as an ally of the Israeli prime minister, as its chief executive. Her arrival was swiftly followed by the cancellation of a popular investigative news programme hosted by the journalist Raviv Drucker, who had exposed a series of scandals about Netanyahu and a recent story about alleged corruption in the transport ministry. The channel’s journalists are openly rebelling against the appointment, claiming it is a sign of Netanyahu’s growing influence over the media in their country. The liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz used an editorial to condemn the decision to take the show off air, calling it “purely a political decision, contravening all financial and journalistic logic”. “This means one thing: Channel 13 has been conquered. The Bibi-ism flag flies over it, and a clear message was delivered to the subjects still employed there: you serve the government here.” Anat Saragusti, who leads the freedom of the press division at Israel’s journalists’ organisation, told the Times of Israel that “what is happening at the Channel 13 News is part of a master plan to destroy the freedom of the press”. Blavatnik’s stake in Channel 13 is owned by the oligarch’s Access Entertainment business, which is led by former BBC director of television Danny Cohen. It has also made high-profile investments in the film production company A24, the interactive art space LightRoom, and successful West End productions such as Hamilton and Cabaret. A spokesperson for Access Industries said: “Sir Leonard Blavatnik believes in the importance of press freedom in Israel and across the world. He has invested a significant amount of money in Israel’s Channel 13 to safeguard its existence and secure the future of free, impartial journalism. The Channel has never had a political agenda – as is the law in Israel – and he has never had editorial input.” “It is categorically not the case that Sir Leonard appointed the CEO of News. The decision as to who runs Channel 13 News is a matter for its independent board on which Sir Leonard has no role. Freedom of expression and informed debate are core values of the channel, and this will always remain the case.” • Footnote added 21 July 2024: After publication of this article, we were contacted by a representative for Sir Len Blavatnik restating his view that “oligarch” is an incorrect description of him. The representative said Blavatnik, who is a UK/US citizen born in Ukraine during the Soviet era, has “divested of all his major Russian assets years ago”. Blavatnik has also stated previously that his “personal and commercial activities are not, and have never been, involved with Putin, Russian politics or the Russian government”.\n",
      "Two bosses of Yorkshire Water have been handed a combined £616,000 in bonuses for a year in which thousands of its customers “struggled to go about their daily lives” for weeks due to a burst water pipe. The payouts, part of a bonus system that could be banned in future under proposals outlined by the Labour government in this week’s king’s speech, were detailed in the company’s annual report. The awards cover a period that also includes nine months of 2023, a year in which Yorkshire Water was named the second-worst water company in England for sewage spills. The company’s chief executive, Nicola Shaw, was paid salary and benefits worth £657,000 for the year to the end of March 2024, topped up by a £371,000 bonus. Shaw, who was appointed in 2022, forfeited her bonus the previous financial year amid public outrage over sewage spills. Yorkshire Water’s chief financial officer, Paul Inman, was paid £436,000 in salary and benefits, as well as a £245,000 bonus. The extra awards are part of a short-term “executive incentive plan”, a cash award that can be collected after a year and is calculated based on measures that include profits, customer service and environmental performance. In April, the water regulator Ofwat said Yorkshire Water had “failed” customers in Goole, East Yorkshire, after a burst water pipe affected 12,700 people for more than a fortnight between October and November 2023. “Residents described how they struggled to go about their daily lives, many were unable to bathe, do household chores, or turn their heating on during the start of the winter period,” Ofwat said at the time. A spokesperson for Yorkshire Water said it had paid out £37,000 in compensation and established a community fund, adding: “We know there were some learnings from how we handled this incident; we’ve taken these onboard and made some changes to improve the service our customers would receive if this incident were to happen again.” Earlier this year, Yorkshire Water was singled out as the second-worst water company for sewage discharge from storm overflows. The company said this was “due to the industrial heritage of parts of our region, and the way the network was created at the time”, adding that it was investing £180m to reduce “discharges into watercourses from our storm overflows”. In its annual report, it said its executive directors received only short-term bonuses because they had not been at the company long enough to take part in any long-term awards. It also said awards under the scheme would not vest (be paid out) unless the company’s pay committee was satisfied that performance had been satisfactory “considering any relevant factors”. A spokesperson said directors were on track to receive 61% of their maximum bonus but that it had reduced this to 42% to reflect environmental performance “not being where we want it to be”. The company has revised its pay and bonus plan for this year. Earlier this week, the chief executive of Southern Water received a £183,000 bonus despite submitting a business plan that has been criticised by Ofwat and attempting to raise bills more than any other English water company. The government has said it will give the water regulator powers to block bonuses at companies that do not meet environmental standards. The measure, announced in the king’s speech on Wednesday, will be accompanied by plans to make water bosses criminally liable for breaking laws on water quality. Yorkshire Water, which serves 5.5 million customers across Yorkshire, parts of Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, has provisionally been given the green light by Ofwat to increase bills from £430 a year to £537 over the next five years. Every water company in England and Wales is  under investigation by Ofwat over sewage spills, it emerged this week.\n",
      "The government has confirmed that it will not provide a £200m loan guarantee to Harland & Wolff, the owner of the stricken Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic, sparking intensified rescue talks between the company and its Wall Street lender. The shipbuilder had hoped to secure a guarantee of up to 80% to help it avoid collapsing into administration for the second time in five years. However, it said on Friday that the Department for Business and Trade had confirmed it would not provide an export development guarantee, triggering “expedited” discussions with US-based creditor Riverstone Credit Management. Rothschild & Co has been engaged to explore “strategic options” for the company, which one source said could also involve it being broken up and sold.  In the meantime, H&W hopes to secure short-term funding from Riverstone, believed to be worth about £20m, in the next few days. The talks will no longer be led by John Wood, its chief executive, who will take a “leave of absence” with immediate effect, five years after leading the previous £6m rescue of the shipbuilder. Wood announced his sudden departure, understood to be a condition imposed by lenders, in a text message to directors overnight on Thursday, according to an earlier report in the Financial Times. Veteran accountant Russell Downs, who worked on the administration of Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers, will join as interim chief executive while talks continue. “The great weight of responsibility for all stakeholders involved in the business to secure a long-term future is crystal clear to me and I am enormously honoured to be given the responsibility to find a solution,” said Downs. “I will be working tirelessly in consultation with employees, management, customers, suppliers, unions, government agencies and other stakeholder groups in the coming weeks.” The shipbuilder was forced to suspend its London-listed shares a fortnight ago, raising concerns about its future. It has missed two deadlines to file audited accounts, raising questions over its finances and its ability to fulfil a £1.6bn contract to build the three “fleet solid support” ships that will carry supplies such as ammunition and food to the navy’s aircraft carriers.   Related: Struggles at Belfast’s Titanic shipyard reflect UK’s faded naval power   The crisis is viewed as the first significant test of industrial policy for the new Labour government in London. The previous government had provisionally approved a partial bailout, under which the state would underwrite 100% of a £200m loan to the company by a consortium of lenders. The DBT decided not to approve the plan, despite H&W reducing its requested loan guarantee to 80%. The company’s remaining directors will continue talks with Riverstone Credit Management, with which it already has a $115m credit facility, charging an interest rate of more than 14%. The UK government, a major customer via Royal Navy contracts, will also be party to the talks, H&W said. The departing CEO, Wood, led the rescue deal in 2019 when the shipyard was bought out of administration by Infrastrata, an energy company listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market. Infrastrata rebranded under the Harland & Wolff name, and turned its focus to rebuilding the shipyard. It also bought the Appledore shipyard in Devon, and the Methil and Arnish yards in Scotland. However, the company has struggled financially with the investments needed to make the yard ready for a big contract. It was in talks with the UK government over a £200m loan guarantee. The guarantee would have allowed the company to refinance its £190m in debt and other liabilities.\n",
      "The new Labour government should remove “ugly” modern phone kiosks that are blighting high streets and attracting litter and graffiti, a leading thinktank has said. A report by Create Streets, founded by the government adviser Nicholas Boys Smith, says there is little need for phone boxes any more and that they do not feature much on the streets of Paris or New York. Unlike the classic red phone box, these kiosks are created and sponsored by phone companies and usually made of clear glass. The report outlines battles between local councils and the big communications corporations, which mean it can cost councils tens of thousands of pounds to get even a single phone box removed. The authors say legislative changes could be needed to give local government enhanced powers to ensure kiosk removal is more straightforward and less costly. At the moment, the companies that own the kiosks can charge tens of thousands in compensation for lost advertising money from the boxes. The report recommends the law is changed so they are only compensated for the costs of removal. Boys Smith said: “Box blight is a menace hiding in plain sight, attracting litter, cluttering up our pavements and making all our streets and square a little bit uglier and less pleasant. We don’t have to put up with this and we shouldn’t. Other countries don’t. Our paper sets out practical steps that the new government can take now to make our streets and town centres better and more prosperous.” The report notes that calls from phone boxes have declined 99.5% from 800m minutes in 2002 to only 4m in 2021-22 due to the ubiquity of mobile phones. It also found that more than half of phoneboxes are likely to be “blighting” the UK’s streets; in one central London study of 64 phone boxes, 38 were either in disrepair, non-operational, or both. If these numbers were extrapolated across the UK’s 15,800 phone boxes, it suggests about 9,300 are afflicted by “box blight”. Alexander Jan, chair of the Central District Alliance, a business support group, said: “London’s pavements (and those of our fellow urban areas) are frequently littered with an array of semi-abandoned modern phone kiosks. These act as magnets for graffiti, littering, fly tipping, drug taking and worse. Councils and business improvement districts spend thousands of pounds a year dealing with them. Outrageously, the only value they typically generate is advertising revenue for their corporate owners.” Create Streets said the the government should amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to make it easier to remove phone boxes, and that it should consult on and draft new legislation to require that communication equipment is kept in a good state of repair. The report also said Historic England should list all the remaining classic red phone boxes, and that these should be kept in a state of good repair as they are part of Britain’s heritage. • This article was amended on 19 July 2024 to correct the given and extrapolated figures in the example of the study of 64 phone boxes in central London.\n",
      "Labour has said it has received the worst economic inheritance since the second world war after official figures showed the government borrowed more than expected in June. Underscoring the challenges facing the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the Office for National Statistics reported that UK borrowing – the difference between public sector spending and income – was £14.5bn last month. Although borrowing in the first three months of 2024-25 was £1.1bn lower than the same period a year earlier, at £49.8bn, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it was £3.2bn above its last forecast, published at the March budget. Labour has warned in the first weeks since its election landslide that, after 14 years of Conservative rule, it has inherited a dire financial position, with the national debt at its highest levels since the 1960s. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said on Friday: “Today’s figures are a clear reminder that this government has inherited the worst economic circumstances since the second world war, but we’re wasting no time to fix it. “Fixing the economy’s foundations and restoring stability is the only way we can create growth and put more money back into people’s pockets across the country. That’s why we’ve introduced our budget responsibility bill, which will ensure that no future government can play fast and loose with the public finances.” Reeves is expected to lay bare the state of public spending in an update to the Commons before the end of the month, in a step insiders say is likely to be used to demonstrate the challenge facing the new government to repair public services and grow the economy. It is believed that the chancellor may not provide the update until the final days before parliament rises for the summer recess on 30 July, as she is expected to travel to Brazil to attend G20 meetings taking place on Thursday and Friday next week. She has yet to announce the date of a first budget, expected this autumn. Reeves has said the OBR requires 10 weeks’ notice to provide independent forecasts. That timeframe would mean no budget until after Labour’s annual party conference in Liverpool in the final week of September. The government is, however, under mounting pressure to find room in the public finances to abolish the two-child limit on benefits, a Tory policy introduced in 2017, which campaigners have labelled as the UK’s single biggest driver of child poverty. Analysis by the Resolution Foundation shows that abolishing the two-child limit would cost about £2.5bn today, rising to £3bn if combined with the abolition of the benefit cap, a separate restriction on benefits limiting the total amount of support a household can receive. Labour refused to commit to abolishing the two-child limit during the general election campaign, saying there were tight constraints on the government finances, and insisting that economic growth was its priority. Cara Pacitti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Weaker-than-expected borrowing so far this year will serve as a reminder to the new chancellor of the huge fiscal challenge she faces ahead of her first budget this autumn. “The fiscal inheritance facing Rachel Reeves is one of rising taxes, falling spending for many public services, and very little wriggle if bad economic news materialises. And data this week on inflation, jobs and government borrowing have not been encouraging.” \n",
      "Nationwide’s takeover of Virgin Money will not reduce competition for mortgages and credit cards, the competition watchdog has ruled, as it gave it the green light. The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid on Friday that the £2.9bn deal, the biggest in banking since the financial crisis, would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the home loans market. Virgin Money shareholders voted overwhelmingly in May in favour of the 220p-a-share deal, with 89% backing the takeover, which could create Britain’s second-largest savings and mortgage provider. This included backing from its largest investor, Sir Richard Branson, who owns a 14.5% stake in the bank he founded in 1995. He is poised to receive £724m from the takeover. Nationwide members were not asked to vote on the transaction as the mutual said it did not need a member vote for the deal. However, more than 600,000 of its members backed all resolutions at its AGM despite calls from campaigners to vote against them as a protest for not being given a specific vote on the deal. The CMA’s investigation looked into whether the newly merged company would lead to a lessening of competition in the mortgage and credit card market, concluding that there would still be sufficient competition. The investigation led to the regulator engaging with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority to assess the impact. Responding to the CMA approval, Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide’s chief executive, said: “We remain on course to receive all the necessary approvals to complete the deal in the final three months of this year.” Virigin Money said: “We welcome the CMA’s decision to unconditionally clear the proposed acquisition by Nationwide after its phase 1 investigation. “The enlarged group will combine two complementary businesses that together can offer more great products and services to a larger customer base.” Virgin Money’s share price has jumped by 35% to more than 215p since the banks announced tthe agreed deal on 7 March. Nationwide will pay £15m in annual royalties to Virgin Group to use the brand name over the first four years, before paying £250m to exit the contract, and eventually phasing out Virgin Money’s name entirely.\n",
      "Retail sales in Great Britain slumped in June by more than forecast as cautious households reined in their spending amid poor weather, election uncertainty and the cost of living crisis. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show retail sales volumes were estimated to have fallen by 1.2% in June, after a rise of 2.9% a month earlier. City economists had predicted a shallower 0.4% decline. Grant Fitzner, the ONS chief economist, said department stores, clothing shops and furniture stores were the biggest contributors to the fall. “Retail sales fell back from May’s recent high point with falls across all main shop types, with the exception of petrol stations.”   Related: Falling inflation, football and fake tan fuel UK retail spending   Sales volumes in food stores fell by 1.1%, mainly because of supermarkets, with retailers suggesting that poor weather and economic conditions deterred spending as households continued to grapple with high living costs. Although inflation has fallen back to the 2% target set by the government, prices remain significantly higher than they were three years ago. Sales volumes in non-food stores dropped 2.1%. The ONS said retailers had suggested that election uncertainty, poor weather and low footfall affected sales. The British Retail Consortium, the industry trade group, said some electronic categories had a better month as consumers replaced items bought during Covid lockdowns, and as sports fans upgraded home entertainment systems for Euro 2024, Wimbledon and the Olympics. Books also sold well as consumers prepared for their holidays. Lisa Hooker, the leader of industry for consumer markets at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: “While July has also got off to a wet and chilly start, retailers will be hoping that the return of warmer weather, longer-term political stability and England’s relative sporting success, encourages consumers to return to the high street, albeit probably too late to save the summer season sales for some retailers.” The figures come as the Bank of England considers whether to cut interest rates from the current level of 5.25% for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic amid concerns that high borrowing costs are weighing on the economy. The Bank will hold its next policy meeting on 1 August. Financial markets predict Threadneedle Street is likely to keep interest rates on hold after underlying measures of inflation in the service sector remained higher than anticipated in June. Separate figures from the ONS also released on Friday showed the UK borrowed more than expected in June, highlighting the challenges for the new Labour government. Public sector net borrowing, excluding state-controlled banks, was £14.5bn last month. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted a reading of £11.5bn. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the figures showed Labour had “inherited the worst economic circumstances since the second world war”. “Fixing the economy’s foundations and restoring stability is the only way we can create growth and put more money back into people’s pockets across the country. That’s why we’ve introduced our budget responsibility bill, which will ensure that no future government can play fast and loose with the public finances,” he said. \n",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index has deepened its losses after this week’s interventions by US presidential candidates, but analysts played down market jitters over chipmakers, saying the artificial intelligence boom would continue to support demand. New York’s Nasdaq composite index staged a brief recovery on opening on Thursday but was down 0.7% at the end of the day, after posting its worst day since December 2022 on Wednesday. The index and chip-related stocks were rattled on Wednesday – with the Nasdaq falling 2.8% – after Bloomberg said the Biden administration was considering limiting Chinese access to semiconductor technology. Donald Trump compounded concerns over political risk by telling the same news organisation that Taiwan, a hub for the global chipmaking industry, should pay for its own defence – at a time when fears of a Chinese invasion or blockade are rising. The US market concerns fed into Asian stocks, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, falling by 2.4% on Thursday. Tokyo Electron shares fell by 8.8% on Thursday, while the Japanese precision tools maker Disco Corp sank by 8.8% and Lasertec, which makes equipment for inspecting for defects in computer chips, shed 6.3%. ASML, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment and a key player in the industry, fell a further 3.9% on Thursday. However, TSMC beat second quarter revenue and profit expectations in results issued after markets closed on Thursday as it said AI-related demand was boosting growth. Shares in Nvidia, a key TSMC customer, were up slightly, by 0.6%, on Thursday, while fellow chipmaker Qualcomm was down 1.9% and Intel was up 3.7%. Dan Coatsworth, an analyst at the London stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “TSMC joins ASML this week in delivering robust figures, yet both companies are seen as vulnerable to a clampdown by the US on the semiconductor industry. “Joe Biden seems intent on making it harder for China to access foreign chip technology, while Donald Trump has upset US relations with global semiconductor hub Taiwan. Geopolitical tensions have acted as a stark reminder to investors that even the hottest of all investment trends can meet bumps in the road.” Analysts said chipmaker stocks should be able to shrug off geopolitical concerns. David Harold, an analyst at Jon Peddie Research, said the market had been a “bit overheated” on chip stocks but he was not expecting Wednesday’s “massive dip”. The US is investing heavily in chip manufacturing infrastructure but Harold said there will be “no major geographical shift in chip making any time soon”, as geopolitical fears over China alarm investors. However, AI-related demand – semiconductors are a key technology in training and operating AI models – will continue, he said, regardless of recent jitters. “This market response is temporary as the underlying factors influencing these markets remain unchanged and AI will continue to push chip demand,” he said. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Trump’s “bark will be way worse than the bite if he wins the White House” and investors had overreacted. Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at the tech research firm Forrester, said Nvidia – which last month became the world’s most valuable company – could cope with any hit to Chinese demand related to a Biden clampdown. “There is enough demand for their products for others to buy what is left over in the short term,” he said.\n",
      "Canary Wharf Group has unveiled plans to remove large chunks from the HSBC tower as part of a revamp of the 42-storey office block when the bank moves out in 2027, in a reflection of the changing face of the east London financial district after the pandemic. The property company said it would carve out sections of the tower’s facade to create terraces as part of plans to transform the block into a mixed-use building that would include leisure facilities and a public viewing gallery. Developers behind the district are attempting to reshape its image as the rise in working from home cuts office demand and has changed when the busiest times are in the Docklands area. Canary Wharf Group (CWG), which manages the building on behalf of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), said it would be the largest-ever conversion of an office tower into a mixed-use building. The revamp, which has been proposed by the US architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, is expected to be finished by about 2030. QIA acquired the property from the National Pension Service of South Korea in 2014 for £1.1bn. The building, known officially as 8 Canada Square, was completed in 2002 and has been the headquarters of HSBC ever since. Last year the bank announced plans to relocate before its lease expires in early 2027. CWG said the tower would continue to include some office space, as well leisure, entertainment and cultural attractions. Designers will carve out new terraces by making some floors smaller, and the building will be divided into defined sections to make it easier to lease. Elie Gamburg, a design principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox, said: “We are extremely excited to collaborate with QIA and CWG to reimagine the single-use office building as a blueprint for the highly sustainable, mixed-use building of the future.” Shobi Khan, the chief executive of CWG, said: “This redevelopment is another step in Canary Wharf’s evolution into a vibrant mixed-use neighbourhood offering workspace, retail, homes, leisure and amenities all in one location – a true 15-minute city.” The FT reported that the conversion could cost between £400m and £800m but the company said those figures had not been precisely budgeted because the design had yet to be finalised. The office property market has taken a hit since Covid-19 as more people work from home and a number of businesses try to reduce the amount of office space they own. Figures from the second quarter of 2023 showed that office occupation at Canary Wharf had fallen to just under 85%, well below the pre-2020 level which was consistently higher than 90%. HSBC said it would move from Canary Wharf to a smaller head office near St Paul’s Cathedral as part of a decision to reduce its office space by 40%. However, there has been a boost to non-professional visitors heading to Canary Wharf, with a record 67 million people going there last year, a quarter more than in the previous year. Canary Wharf was the creation of the late Canadian property tycoon Paul Reichmann, who befriended the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The late former PM gave the development generous tax breaks as part of the project to overhaul London’s Docklands. Construction began in 1988 and its first skyscraper, the 244-metre One Canada Square, topped by a pyramid, was Britain’s tallest building for two decades until the opening of the Shard in London Bridge in 2012. The district’s fortunes have largely reflected the wider economy, buffeted by the recessionary headwinds of the early 1990s, the 2008 financial crisis and latterly the pandemic and its after-effects. Much of Docklands’ transformation can be credited to George Iacobescu, who escaped poverty in Romania and would ultimately lead the Canary Wharf Group. He retires as its chair this month. In response to the pandemic-fuelled shift towards home working, the developers behind Canary Wharf have attempted to shake off its sterile architectural image, adding shops, housing, restaurants and bars, and landscaping the areas between its glass and steel towers. Its backers have also tried to bring in new footfall through public attractions, including outdoor public art trails and free family events such as open-air film screenings and music and theatre festivals.\n",

      "The chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company has said it was “too easy to point a finger” at the delivery company over delays to postal votes, as it reported a rise in revenue helped by the general election.  The postal company’s owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), which is the subject of a £3.6bn takeover bid from a Czech billionaire, said letter revenues rose 11.2% in the three months to the end of June. Its sales rose on the back of record numbers of postal votes and higher stamp prices. Deliveries of postal vote returns increased by 50% compared with the election in December 2019, and 30% more candidate mail was delivered than in the run-up to that poll. Royal Mail was criticised before the election as concerned voters fretted over delays to their ballot papers. Some did not arrive in time before holidaymakers headed abroad and the then postal affairs minister, Kevin Hollinrake, claimed there was a “resourcing issue” in Royal Mail. At the time, the company denied there was a backlog in postal votes and said it was delivering the ballot packs as soon as they arrived in its network from local councils.   Related: Royal Mail to stop using its own freight trains after almost 200 years   Martin Seidenberg, the group chief executive of IDS, said it was “probably worthwhile reviewing the processes and procedures” around elections. He cited the surprise short timeframe between the former prime minister Rishi Sunak calling the election and Britain going to the polls, and the time taken to print materials. Seidenberg said: “You can’t really point a finger at just one or two [things] … it’s been a combination. What we got, we delivered – it’s too easy to point a finger just at Royal Mail.” He added: “If there will be an independent investigation, we will support it.” The delays even raised the prospect of close results in constituencies being challenged in the high court because of delayed postal votes. On Thursday, Royal Mail said 7.3m completed postal votes had been posted. It delivered 50.8m polling cards, and 184m pieces of candidate mail. However, excluding election mail, letter volumes fell 4%. Seidenberg said: “I am proud and thankful for all the extra effort our postmen and women put in to play our part in delivering democracy.” The company’s revenues were also boosted by an increase in stamp prices. In April, the price of a first class stamp increased by 10p to £1.35, with second class rising from 75p to 85p. IDS group revenues rose 8.2% to £3.3bn in the first quarter of its financial year, with Royal Mail making a £2bn contribution, up 10.6%, and a further £1.3bn deriving from its international parcels arm, GLS, a 4.8% increase. The financial update comes as the Czech tycoon Daniel Křetínský progresses his bid to take IDS private, 11 years after Royal Mail was turned into a listed company under the coalition government. Křetínský, IDS’s biggest investor, has faced questions over his long-term intentions for Royal Mail and the dealings of his longtime business partners. The low-profile energy tycoon, who also owns stakes in the football club West Ham United and the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, this week told the BBC he would honour a commitment to deliver the universal service obligation (USO) “as long as I live”. On Thursday, the company set up to acquire IDS said it was “fully committed” to the statutory obligation, and supported a proposal by Royal Mail to pare back second class deliveries to every other weekday. It has also agreed with the government not to sell Royal Mail or GLS for at least three years. Asked whether he trusted Křetínský, Seidenberg said: “I have had some endeavours with him as part of him being an investor and [the bid] does sound genuine to me.” As politicians appeared in front of the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal, Seidenberg said: “I feel very sorry for what happened there, because it’s personal tragedies behind it.” The Post Office was part of Royal Mail Group when the Horizon scandal began but was spun out in 2012. Seidenberg said many customers did not realise they were now separate entities. “We’re not happy with such a strong connection at this point in terms of recognition. This will only be something you can deal with over time.” \n",
      "Boeing faces fresh questions about the safety of its aircraft after an engine fire on a transatlantic flight from Edinburgh caused an emergency landing soon after takeoff. Flames were seen by passengers briefly shooting from the engine of a Delta Air Lines 767 soon after it took off for New York in February last year, after a turbine blade broke off during takeoff. The flames subsided while the plane was airborne but it made an emergency landing at Prestwick airport south of Glasgow, where ground crew noticed fuel leaking from the plane’s right wing. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the UK government agency that investigates aviation safety, has written to the Federal Aviation Administration in the US asking it to take action with Boeing, which has its headquarters in Virginia. The AAIB said the fractured turbine blade damaged five other blades in the engine. Vibrations from the “out of balance turbine” caused a tube carrying fuel in the wing to fracture, leading fuel to escape from the wing’s fuel tank. The fuel was ignited by the engine’s hot air exhaust, with footage of the flames captured by a passenger sitting near the wing. In a statement, the AAIB said: “A safety recommendation has been made to the Federal Aviation Administration that requires the Boeing Aircraft Company to demonstrate that following this serious incident, the design of the slat track housing drain tube on the Boeing 767 family of aircraft continues to comply with the certification requirements for large transport aircraft.” The Delta flight to JFK airport in New York was carrying 211 passengers and 10 crew. It said two members of the cabin crew had heard a rattling sound as the Boeing taxied for takeoff, which appeared to come from the cargo hold. Nothing abnormal was seen or heard by the pilots, but the noise continued during takeoff. They warned the flights purser, who tried but failed to warn the pilots on the plane’s internal phone. She made contact at the second attempt and said passengers were alarmed by the “quite bad” noise. A temperature indicator for the right engine began fluctuating. The flight commander walked the length of the aircraft but could not locate any specific issues. He decided to divert the plane to Prestwick, which has long runways, as a precaution. En route to Prestwick, the flames were filmed by a passenger. The flames disappeared and the commander decided to fly on with the right engine at reduced power. There were no injuries as a result of the incident but the AAIB said all those onboard were “rapidly disembarked” once the fuel leak was spotted at Prestwick. Boeing has been contacted for comment. This is the latest in a series of safety incidents involving Boeing aircraft, which have contributed to company executives leaving in a management shake-up. It pleaded guilty to US criminal charges over the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019 after violating an agreement with regulators in 2021. It has also been sanctioned after a 737 Max 9 cabin panel blew out in mid-air on an Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon, in January this year. A number of whistleblowers have gone public with concerns about safety culture and management at the company. In 2021, the UK government temporarily banned from British airspace Boeing 777 aircraft which used the same type of engine which caught fire over Denver, Colorado. • This article was amended on 18 July 2024.

      "Pret a Manger is axing its subscription offering members “free drinks”, almost four years after the deal launched in the UK to attract customers back after the Covid pandemic. In a move that has upset some customers, the coffee chain said it was “time to rethink” the Club Pret offer, and that instead of providing five drinks a day and a 20% discount on food for a cost of £30 a month, it would charge £10 for a subscription for half-price drinks. Its offering of five free hot or iced barista-made drinks has been running for four years. Last year it increased the price and added a discount for food, which led to two sets of price tags on its shelves. Pret said it would eliminate this dual pricing across food products, something the company’s UK managing director, Clare Clough, said the chain “never really got comfortable with”. The new subscription will be introduced in September. For existing and new subscribers, the fee will start at £5 a month until 31 March 2025 and then rise to £10. “We know this is a change. But with Club Pret subscription, our coffees, teas, coolers, and iced drinks will continue to be the best offer on the high street, and at a much more accessible price than the £360 a year people have to pay for the current scheme,” Clough said. She added that “given the majority of our customers are not Club Pret subscribers, our priority now is to focus on better value for everyone”. There was a hostile reaction to the change from some quarters, with people airing their frustration on social media. One X user directed their response to Pret, saying: “You are making a huge mistake. There is time to rectify it. Otherwise, I am cancelling my subscription.” Another said: “I’m genuinely shocked that you think that it’s acceptable to try to auto-enrol people off of the current subscription plan to your … 50% off in September. This should be an opt-in system due to the level of change to the scheme.” Last year, Pret a Manger returned to profit for the first time since 2018, with the launch of its subscription service helping the coffee and bakery chain bounce back after the Covid crisis. The group, which suffered during the pandemic lockdowns when office workers stayed at home, said sales jumped 20% to £430m in the six months to the end of June 2023. Pret’s subscription service generated 57.9m redemptions globally in 2022, up two-thirds from a year before.\n",
      "UK wage growth slowed in May to the lowest level in two years amid a cooling jobs market, underscoring the challenge for the Bank of England as policymakers decide whether to cut interest rates. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show annual pay growth eased from 5.9% in the three months to April to 5.7% in the three months to May, matching City economists’ predictions. Unemployment was unchanged from 4.4% in April, while the number of job vacancies fell by 30,000 led by dwindling demand in retail and hospitality amid a continued slowdown in hiring across the economy. After a sharp fall in headline inflation over recent months, real wage growth taking into account the rising cost of living has strengthened. Total real pay, including bonuses, rose by 3% on the year in the three months to May. Growth was last higher in the three months to August 2021, when it was 4.5%. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: “We continue to see overall some signs of a cooling in the labour market, with the growth in the number of employees on the payroll weakening over the medium term and unemployment gradually increasing. “Earnings growth in cash terms, while remaining relatively strong, is showing signs of slowing again. However, with inflation falling, in real terms it is at its highest rate in over two and a half years.” In a sign of the cooling labour market, the latest snapshot showed there were now more than 500,000 more people out of work than this time last year, driven by a rise in economic inactivity – when working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one. Although economic inactivity has come down in recent months, it remains close to a record high at almost 9.4 million, with almost a third outside the workforce due to near record levels of long-term sickness. Liz Kendall, the new work and pensions secretary, said the UK was standing alone as the only G7 country where the employment rate was not back to pre-pandemic levels. “This is a truly dire inheritance which the government is determined to tackle,” she said. “Behind these statistics are real people, who have for too long been ignored and denied the support they need to get into work and get on at work. It’s time for change.” Financial markets expect Bank policymakers will hold off from cutting interest rates from the current level of 5.25% at their meeting on 1 August, instead waiting until they are convinced that inflation will remain close to the government’s 2% target before reducing the cost of borrowing. Threadneedle Street has previously warned that inflation is likely to rise above 2% this year amid resilient wage growth and price increases in the service sector of the economy. The figures come after headline inflation unexpectedly remained at 2% in June for a second month in a row, while underlying measures from the service sector also held steady in a development likely to dash hopes for an August rate cut. Although wage growth is cooling, economists said at 5.7% it remained inconsistent with the Bank’s 2% inflation target. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the slowdown in the jobs market probably was not enough to offset strength in services inflation. “As a result, we have changed our forecast for the timing of the first interest rate cut from 5.25% from August to September, although it is a close call,” he said. Several members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Last month the European Central Bank became the first major global central bank to cut official borrowing costs. On Thursday it left interest rates unchanged.  The US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, this week hinted that it would not necessarily wait for US inflation to drop to its 2% target before cutting interest rates, bolstering expectations for a cut in September. \n",
      "The UK’s biggest banks have been told by the City watchdog to do more to ensure parliamentarians, senior public servants and their families are treated fairly in the wake of the Nigel Farage debanking row. In a warning to financial firms – including banks, payment firms and lenders – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said they should not disadvantage people running for office or taking senior public roles. It follows the political row last year triggered by Farage after the prestigious private bank Coutts closed his account, leading to a media storm and the issue being taken up by the then Conservative government. Farage argued the closure was likely to have been linked to his status as a politically exposed person (PEP) and claims in the Commons that he had received payments from Moscow’s state-funded broadcaster, Russia Today. Details leaked to the BBC suggested Farage had fallen below Coutts’ commercial criteria, which require customers to hold at least £3m in savings, or borrow or invest at least £1m with the bank.   Related: ‘Unfair banking’ and ‘damaging’ financial rules harming UK’s small firms, MPs warn   However, Farage later obtained evidence through a subject access request which he claimed showed that Coutts took action because of his political values, leading to wider questions over whether banks were treating politically exposed customers fairly. The scandal led to the resignation of Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest Group, the part-taxpayer-owned lender rescued by the UK government in the 2008 financial crisis, which owns Coutts. Farage, who earlier this month was elected to represent Clacton as an MP for the Reform UK party, is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after leaving the king’s speech debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday to fly to the US Republican national convention. For several years before the row over Farage’s Coutts account, charity groups had been warning they were being caught by banks de-risking their exposure to politically sensitive customers, amid a rush in the industry to comply with tougher money laundering laws and scrutiny after the 2008 financial crisis. The FCA said on Thursday it had carried out a review and found most firms did not subject PEPs to excessive or disproportionate checks and none would deny them an account based on their status. “However all firms could improve,” it added. The regulator said it was telling financial firms to ensure their definition of a PEP, family member, or close associate was “tightened to the minimum required by law” and not to go beyond that. Firms should also review the status of PEPs and their associates when they leave public office, improve staff training, explain to their customers any actions taken, and “effectively consider the actual level of risk” they pose. Sarah Pritchard, the FCA’s executive director of markets and international, said: “Public service naturally comes with greater scrutiny. But it must be proportionate and shouldn’t disadvantage people running for office or taking senior public roles, or their families. That requires a balancing act. “Most firms try to get it right but there is more they can do. We’re following up with those firms that were getting the balance wrong to ensure they make changes.”\n",
      "The date for the introduction of the EU’s new entry-exit system has been pushed back again until November, allaying fears of long queues at the border during the October half-term holidays. The launch of the new biometric checks for foreign travellers, including Britons, entering the EU, has been delayed from 6 October until at least 10 November, with many smaller airports yet to have facilities in place. The European Commission has not confirmed a new date but some ports and airports have been briefed to expect a later start – with a “last resort” date of 17 November, according to a report in the Independent. The move will again raise questions over the readiness of a system that has been long delayed from the planned 2021 start, with the French insisting the additional border controls should not be introduced before the Paris Olympics. Under the entry-exit system (EES), non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric information – including fingerprints and facial scans – at the border, under the supervision of an EU officer, on their first visit. There have been warnings of long queues at British points of entry – including the Port of Dover, and Eurostar’s St Pancras terminal – where the French and EU border is physically located in England, before passengers board ferries or trains. European airports, whose late summer season could have run into the EES deadline, had urged a further postponement. Eurostar has invested millions in revamping St Pancras with pre-check-in areas containing kiosks to register most of the biometric data, which will then have to be checked again by the French border police. The cross-Channel train operator said the process would add only a few seconds to border queues and not cause chaos, although passengers would have to ensure they arrived in time for the additional layer of biometric checks. Getlink, the operator of Le Shuttle, which takes vehicles through the Channel tunnel, has spent €78m (£66m) providing new facilities to ensure a smooth introduction. It expects EES will mean an additional six to seven minutes to process a carful of passengers. The Port of Dover, which has limited space to create additional facilities and whose travellers often include coaches, has been particularly concerned about the potential for long queues. The European airports trade body, ACI Europe, had called on the European Commission to reconsider the October date, as it would mean additional work to prepare facilities and staff when the industry would still be at full stretch in the peak season.

      "The stocks of some of the world’s largest chipmakers have fallen further after comments by Donald Trump that Taiwan, which is central to the global industry, should pay for its own defences against China. Shares in semiconductor and related tech companies had already plunged on Wednesday after the former president’s comments, as well as a report that suggested Joe Biden’s administration was considering the strictest controls on the trade of chips to China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, fell by 2.4% on Thursday. That followed a 7% fall the previous day, when Trump questioned why the US was acting as Taiwan’s “insurance” when, he claimed, it had taken away America’s chip business. On Wednesday, the US’s tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index had its worst day since December 2022, falling 2.8%, after an unconfirmed Bloomberg report suggested Biden was considering introducing the most severe restrictions on companies if they continued to give China access to semiconductor technology. It said the US president was considering whether to impose a measure called the foreign direct product rule, which would allow the US to impose controls on foreign-made products that use even tiny amounts of US technology. That would have a particular impact on companies such as ASML, the Dutch manufacturer of machines used to produce microchips, and Japan’s Tokyo Electron, which some in the US government believe are giving China too much access to their advanced semiconductor technology. Tokyo Electron shares fell by 8.8% on Thursday, while the Japanese precision tools maker Disco Corp sank by 8.8% and Lasertec, which makes equipment for inspecting for defects in computer chips, shed 6.3%. Shares at ASML fell by a further 2% in the early hours of trading on Thursday, after an 11% plunge the previous day. The US chipmaker Nvidia was also caught up in the market slide, falling by 6% on Wednesday. The comments by Trump, who is the favourite to win the US presidential race in November, indicate that military support for Taiwan in the event of action from China would not be guaranteed if he re-entered the White House. Commenting on China’s aggression towards its neighbour, Trump said he “wouldn’t feel too secure” if he were Taiwan. He said the US was “no different than an insurance company”, suggested Taipei should be paying the US to defend it and claimed Taiwan “doesn’t give us anything”. Taiwan produces more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips, mostly through TSMC, and is a big supplier to Apple and Nvidia. The country’s premier, Cho Jung-tai, said on Wednesday he was grateful to the US for its support, and that Taiwan was “working hard” to maintain the relationship while also increasing its self-defence capabilities. • This article was amended on 18 July 2024. An earlier version incorrectly described ASML as a “chipmaker”; in fact, it manufactures the machines used to make chips.\n",
      "In July 1944, exactly 80 years ago, representatives of 44 countries met in an obscure New Hampshire village to negotiate the Bretton Woods Agreement establishing the International Monetary Fund. For many, reaching the ripe old age of 80 would be cause for celebration. For the IMF, the anniversary only highlights the urgency of reform. Some necessary reforms are straightforward and widely agreed, raising the question of why they haven’t been adopted. First, the IMF should provide its members with regular annual allocations of its in-house financial instrument, special drawing rights. This would provide an alternative to the US dollar as a source of global liquidity while also addressing the problem of chronic global imbalances. Second, the IMF needs to do better at organising debt restructurings for low-income countries. Its latest attempt, the rather grandly named Common Framework for Debt Treatments, has fallen short. The Fund needs to push harder for cooperation from China’s government and financial institutions, which are unfamiliar with the responsibilities of a sovereign creditor. It should support reforms to speed up restructurings and endorse initiatives to crack down on holdout creditors.   Related: UK interest rates will stay high unless service sector inflation falls, says IMF   In terms of its surveillance of countries’ policies, the IMF needs to address its perceived lack of even-handedness; whereas emerging and developing countries are held to demanding standards, high-income countries such as the US are let off the hook. It needs to reinvigorate its analysis of the cross-border spillovers of large-country policies, a process the US has managed to squelch. As for its lending policies, the IMF needs to decouple loan size from an anachronistic quota system and reduce the punitive interest rates charged middle-income countries. To ensure the best possible leadership, the managing director should be selected through a competitive process, where candidates submit statements and sit for interviews, after which shareholding governments vote. The victor should be the most qualified individual and not just the most qualified European, as has historically been the case. Most of all, the IMF must acknowledge that it can’t be everything for everyone. Under recent managing directors, it has broadened its agenda from its core mandate, preserving economic and financial stability, to encompass gender equity, the climate crisis, and other nontraditional issues. These are not topics about which the IMF’s macroeconomists have expertise. The IMF’s own internal watchdog, the Independent Evaluation Office, has rightly warned that venturing into these areas can overstretch the Fund’s human and management resources. Admittedly, the IMF can’t ignore the climate crisis, since such events affect economic and financial stability. Women’s education, labour force participation and childcare arrangements belong on its agenda insofar as they have implications for economic growth and hence for debt sustainability. Fundamentally, however, gender-related policies and climate adaptation are economic development issues. They require long-term investments. As such, they fall mainly within the bailiwick of the World Bank, the IMF’s sister institution across 19th Street in Washington. An advantage of an agenda focused on the IMF’s core mandate is that national governments are more likely to give the Fund’s management and staff the freedom of action needed to move quickly in response to developments threatening economic and financial stability. The IMF lacks the independence of national central banks. Currently, decision-making is slow by the standards of financial crises, which move fast. Decisions must be approved by an executive board of political appointees who in turn answer to their governments. But central bank independence is viable only because central bankers have a narrow mandate focused on price stability, against which their actions can be judged. For a quarter-century, observers have argued that a more independent, fleet-footed IMF would be better. But the more the institution dilutes its agenda, the more such independence resembles a pipe dream. The other factor underpinning the viability of central-bank independence is that monetary policymakers at the national level are accountable to legitimate political actors, generally parliaments and ministers. The legitimacy of IMF accountability is more dubious, owing to the institution’s governance structure. For antiquated reasons, the US – and only the US – possesses a veto over consequential IMF decisions. Europe is overrepresented in the institution, while China is underrepresented. Until these imbalances are corrected, the Fund’s governance will remain under a shadow. This not only makes the prospect of operational independence even more remote; it also stands in the way of virtually all meaningful reforms, including the straightforward changes listed above. Sketching a reform agenda for the IMF is easy. Implementing it is hard. Real reform will require the US to give up its veto in the institution. It will require China to assume more responsibility for global stability and the problems of other economies. And it will require the US and China to work together. For two countries that haven’t shown much ability to cooperate in recent years, IMF reform would be a good place to start. • Barry Eichengreen is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior policy adviser at the IMF © Project Syndicate\n",

      "Talks between the train drivers’ union Aslef and the Department for Transport (DfT) will take place next week as the new Labour government seeks a swift resolution to the long-running national pay dispute. Aslef’s general secretary, Mick Whelan, said he believed fresh talks “can and will get a deal”, more than two years on from the start of a series of strikes by drivers that have halted train services around the country.  The early meeting comes after the government announced more protections for workers and early steps to ensure rail nationalisation in the king’s speech on Wednesday, with the first reading of passenger railway services legislation now due on Thursday. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, met union leaders last week and promised “an era of grownup industrial relations”. Aslef’s team will hold initial talks directly with the DfT rather than through the representatives of train operators. Steve Montgomery, First Group’s rail director and the former chair of the Rail Delivery Group, who led previous talks for the industry, is no longer in the process. The meeting on Tuesday is expected to be led instead by Alex Hynes, the DfT’s director general of rail services. Whelan said: “We hope, with a new government in place, that we can have constructive talks to get a positive resolution that works for train drivers, who have not had an increase in salary for five years – since 2019 – and will help get our railway back on track. “Mark Harper, Huw Merriman and the Tory government put the brakes on any deal. Now, with a new secretary of state for transport in place, I hope and think we can, and will, get a deal done.” No talks or meetings with the previous government to resolve the dispute had been held since Aslef rejected a deal worth 8% over two years in early 2023, which also included a number of changes to working conditions. It is understood that the union’s leadership could recommend to members a similar increase on a no-strings basis, accepting that any pay rise is likely to still be well below the rates of inflation seen since 2019. The RMT union is no longer in dispute with train operators or Network Rail, although the union is still negotiating over 2024 rises. Its general secretary, Mick Lynch, said it would “actively engage with the government on the pay issues in our sectors which can be resolved quickly”.\n",
      "When a handful of Hong Kong journalists dialled in to a media call with HSBC bosses in February, Georges Elhedery took them by surprise. In a momentary distraction from the bank’s 80% drop in annual profits, the chief financial officer issued greetings in Mandarin. It put Elhedery’s newly acquired language skills – built up during a six-month sabbatical in 2022 – to a public test. But it also demonstrated his ambition: notably, that he would not let a relative lack of experience in China, where the bank makes the bulk of its profits, get in the way of his ascent at HSBC. Four months later, Elhedery’s drive has been duly rewarded, having been selected to take over from Noel Quinn as chief executive from September. While it is no surprise that HSBC appointed an internal candidate, it is still a coup for the Lebanese-born and French-educated banker, who joined HSBC in 2005 after a four-year stint at Goldman Sachs. He won over board members during his 18 months as chief financial officer, including HSBC’s tough chair, Mark Tucker, who has now outlasted three chief executives since taking the role in 2017. On Wednesday, Tucker called Elhedery, 50, the “outstanding candidate”, saying he had a record of “driving growth, delivering simplification and containing costs” and brought “deep international perspectives” to the role. Elhedery has also gained fans among investors and banking colleagues, who have described him as clever, diligent and gentle, and a clear communicator. Add his seven languages to the mix and the bank has the makings of a skilful diplomat, poised to help HSBC, which operates in 62 countries and territories, and also navigate one of the trickiest roles in global banking. “This is a more politicised appointment than virtually any other bank, given the need for any CEO to have the capability to get on with clients, regulators and politicians globally,” said Thomas Moore, a senior investment director at one of HSBC’s shareholders, Abrdn. Geopolitical tensions between the west and China will be one of the biggest challenges for the incoming boss as he oversees the lender’s $3tn balance sheet. And Elhedery will inherit an increasingly Asia-focused lender. Quinn and Tucker helped to further pivot the bank towards China, investing billions in joint ventures, private banking and wealth management in the region. While they have staved off calls from the activist investor Ping An to split off the lucrative Asia business, they did so in part by selling and scaling down operations in countries including the US, France and Canada. The strategy left Quinn walking a tightrope when political tensions flared. He became notorious for dodging questions about HSBC’s willingness to work with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing, after the bank’s bosses controversially accepted China’s authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Elhedery will have to steel himself for further political pressure if Donald Trump wins the US election in November. If comments from Trump’s newly appointed running mate and prospective vice-president, JD Vance, are any indication, tensions between Washington and Beijing could reach fresh heights. “I don’t like China,” Vance told CBS in May as he bluntly blamed the country for problems in the US jobs market. Even colleagues who praise Elhedery’s skills say he faces an uphill battle. “China tensions are unmanageable: it doesn’t matter who the CEO is,” they said. “HSBC is now all-in to China. They now need to prepare to ride the tiger. It won’t be easy.” HSBC’s exposure to China’s lingering property and economic crises could also heap pressure on Elhedery, who in February announced that the bank had taken a shock $3bn impairment on its exposure to the Chinese lender BoCom. While Quinn has predicted a “progressive and gradual recovery” in China’s commercial real estate market, data in May showed house prices falling at their fastest rate in nearly a decade. Official figures this week also showed the economy grew 4.7% in the second quarter, falling short of expectations for a 5.1% rise. Income will also be squeezed in the west, as Elhedery grapples with the start of a new rate-cutting cycle by central banks. HSBC’s net interest income, which is the difference between what is earned from loans versus what is paid out to savers, grew 20% to $36bn in 2023 thanks to high interest rates. Analysts are now expecting the figure to fall back to $33bn for the current financial year as that trend reverses. But analysts are welcoming the certainty that comes with Elhedery’s appointment. UBS’s European banking expert Jason Napier said: “We expect [a] stable strategy.” \n",
      "The message from the king’s speech was clear. After 14 years in opposition, Labour is back with a plan to get the economy moving. The brakes on growth are coming off, says the prime minister. In a way, the measures outlined to achieve the government’s “mission” hark back to Labour governments of the past. There is to be more nationalisation, more centralised control of planning, more power for workers, an industrial strategy council and a national wealth fund to boost investment in infrastructure projects. Economic policy under Keir Starmer will become more interventionist and have a discernible social-democratic tinge to it. But only modestly so. This will not be a tax-and-spend government prepared to boost growth by borrowing for long-term investment. Active demand management is not part of the plan. Instead, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will be forced to get the approval of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for any major tax and spending decisions she intends to take. This proposal is really just for show, since Reeves has shown no desire to emulate Liz Truss, who came a cropper after sidelining the OBR and announcing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts in September 2022. But with interest rates set by the technocrats at the Bank of England and fiscal policy policed by the technocrats at the OBR, it leaves little scope for the government to act on the demand side of the economy. Labour won’t mind this, because it thinks the real problems of the economy lie on the supply side, and that a period of stability is needed to allow reforms to work. These weaknesses include the poor state of public infrastructure, low levels of business investment, weak productivity growth and inadequate skills. With that in mind, the two most important bills announced in the speech involve planning and the workplace. Both have the advantage of potentially being transformative without costing the government serious amount of money.   Related: From education and energy to renters and railways: key points from the king’s speech   Planning reform is seen as key to unlocking the door to faster growth. There will be national targets for housebuilding and a national strategy for infrastructure. The planning system will be reformed and streamlined. Democratic engagement will be about where, not if, new homes and infrastructure are built. This top-down approach is almost certain to be tested in the courts and is at odds with Labour’s separate plans to devolve more power to local authorities and metro mayors. It might not be universally popular in some of Labour’s newly won seats in the leafy shires either. Business likes the sound of planning reform but is less keen on the employment rights bill, which will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, end fire and rehire, provide a range of employment rights from a worker’s first day in a new job, and make it easier for trade unions to organise and operate. Employers have expressed concern that the reforms will make the labour market less flexible. The government’s argument is that flexibility has not resulted in higher productivity or strong real wage growth, and that the changes will lead to companies being encouraged to invest more in new labour-saving equipment and in training. Labour has been fortunate in coming to power with inflation back at 2% and growth on a gentle upswing. It will need to stay lucky because changes to the supply side of the economy are unlikely to bear fruit overnight and even then the impact will not appear dramatic. Estimates of the economy’s long-term sustainable growth rate range from 1% to 1.5%. If Labour manages to push that up by 0.25 percentage points by the end of this parliament it will be doing extremely well.\n",

      "The energy giant Shell has quietly backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling”, a practice oil and petrochemical producers have promoted as a solution to the plastics pollution crisis. “Advanced” or “chemical” recycling involves breaking down plastic polymers into tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. The most common form, pyrolysis, does so using heat. Shell has invested in pyrolysis since 2019, touting it as a way to slash waste. That year, the company used oil made via pyrolysis in one of its Louisiana chemical plants for the first time. And it began publicizing a new goal for the technology: “Our ambition is to use 1m tonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemicals plants by 2025.” But recently, the company rolled back that promise with little fanfare: “[I]n 2023 we concluded that the scale of our ambition to turn 1m tonnes of plastic waste a year into pyrolysis oil by 2025 is unfeasible,” it said in its 2023 sustainability report, published in March. Reached for comment, a Shell spokesperson, Curtis Smith, said: “Our ambition, regardless of regulation, is to increase circularity and move away from a linear economy to one where products and materials are reused, repurposed and recycled.” The company has not called attention to this retraction, but it is a “significant” change, said Davis Allen, investigative researcher at the Center for Climate Integrity, which shared the finding with the Guardian. “It’s an acknowledgment that advanced recycling is not developing in the way that companies have promised it will, and are counting on it to,” he said. “That’s pretty meaningful.” Researchers and environmental advocates have long raised concerns about advanced recycling, warning it can create even more toxic and planet-heating pollution than virgin plastic production and is even more energy intensive than traditional plastic recycling. Studies show the facilities are most likely to harm communities that are already vulnerable to contamination and climate threats. But that is not why Shell struck its pledge. In the report, the company said the walk-back was necessary due to changes in the market. “While Shell sees customer demand for circular chemicals, the pace of growth globally is less than expected due to lack of available feedstock, slow technology development and regulatory uncertainty,” the document says. Complaints of insufficient feedstock may seem a surprising when hundreds of millions of tons of plastic are produced each year. But despite what is suggested in marketing materials, post-consumer items such as food packaging and empty soap bottles cannot easily be recycled via pyrolysis. The process works best with clean, homogeneous inputs, but sorting and cleaning plastic is expensive. As a result, most chemical recycling facilities working at scale rely mostly on processed industrial scrap – or “plastic left on the cutting room floor during production”, said Allen. Slow technology development has indeed been a factor in the advanced recycling market said Allen, but one that Shell “maybe should have seen coming”. The industry has claimed pyrolysis will be a groundbreaking solution to plastic waste for many years; Allen recently found a lobby group document making such claims in the 1970s. But experts have also told the the sector for decades that there are practical issues with advanced recycling, the Center for Climate Integrity has found. Today, there is mounting evidence that advanced recycling “often just does not work”, said Judith Enck, president of advocacy group Beyond Plastics and a former EPA regional administrator. Many of the United States’ 11 advanced recycling facilities operate only partially, and two have been shut down altogether. Shell’s third reason for walking back their pledge – regulatory uncertainty – probably refers to a rapidly changing advanced recycling policy landscape. Many states have recently passed pro-advanced recycling legislation, due largely to lobbying by the powerful industry group the American Chemistry Council, said Enck. But some regulators are moving in the other direction. The Environmental Protection Agency last year withdrew a plan to ease some regulations on pyrolysis, while New Jersey recently decided chemically recycled material should not be considered recycled plastic. Other plastic producers, such as Exxon and Dow, have also pledged to rapidly expand their advanced recycling capacities. The technology can bring forth a “circular” plastics economy that reduces the need to use virgin fossil fuels, the industry often claims. “The commitments have tied into a broader strategy to push advanced recycling as an answer to all of the public’s concerns about plastic waste,” said Allen. “It lets them say, ‘it won’t matter that we’re producing [several times] the amount of plastic that we’re producing now in several decades, because it will all be circular.” Though it has reversed this advanced recycling pledge, Shell does not appear to be backing away from its plans to expand plastic production. It recently opened a chemical complex as large as 300 football fields near Pittsburgh, with the capacity to produce 1.6m tons of plastic a year. It is also still a member of the American Chemistry Council and its subgroup America’s Plastic Makers, which has recently been running an ad promoting advanced recycling which asks audiences to “imagine a future where plastic is not wasted, but instead remade over and over”. Still, the retraction is a tacit acknowledgment of the longstanding issues with the technology, said Enck. “I have never said this before, but Shell has made a wise decision here,” she said. “Chemical recycling is a polluting and an unreliable way to address the growing problem of plastics.”\n",
      "  3.10pm BST  Closing summary  The pound has gained 0.5% against the dollar to $1.3028, and earlier touched $1.3044. It was last trading at the $1.30 level in mid-July 2023. Sterling has also hit a two-year against the euro, of €1.1927, and is currently trading up nearly 0.1% at €1.1909. The UK currency was boosted by higher-than-expected inflation data, which led to markets paring back expectations of an interest rate cut in August. Before the data, they were almost 50-50; now the probability of a rate cut at the Bank of England’s next meeting on 1 August is seen at 35%. The chances of an August interest rate cut took a blow after a sharp jump in hotel prices meant progress in the UK’s fight against inflation stalled last month. A near 9% jump in the cost of a hotel room – blamed by some analysts on a “Taylor Swift effect” – offset the impact of cut-price clothing to leave the government’s preferred measure of the cost of living at its 2% target for a second month in a row in June. With measures of underlying inflation also holding steady, the City said the prospect of the Bank of England reducing the cost of borrowing from its current level of 5.25% at its next meeting on 1 August had diminished.

Bye!-JK  Updated at 3.12pm BST    2.59pm BST  US industrial production rises more than expected   In the United States, industrial production rose by 0.6% in June from May, which was better than expected. Within this, manufacturing output rose by 0.4%, driven by car and aerospace production.  Industrial production also benefitted from a 2.8% jump in utilities output, likely reflecting the unseasonably warm start to the summer and the associated boost to air conditioning demand. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said this industrial strength is unlikely to have continued into July.  As vehicle sales dropped back in June, it seems unlikely that the rise in motor vehicle production will be repeated. The manufacturing survey indicators continue to paint a gloomy picture of conditions elsewhere, with the ISM manufacturing index at just 48.5 in June.  Similarly, as temperatures have been closer to their seasonal norms so far this month, utilities output will probably quickly drop back. Overall, it seems likely that some of the strength in industrial production in June will be reversed this month.       2.55pm BST   Returning to the government’s plans for housing, the Federation of Master Builders points out that its bold plans to build 1.5m homes over the next five years, the current skills crisis in the construction industry needs to be addressed. Brian Berry, the FMB’s chief executive, said:  We are substantially lacking the skilled workers required to build new homes, and to upgrade our existing homes with the energy efficiency improvements which Labour have pledged. The UK is in desperate need of a long-term skills plan, to establish clear pathways into careers in construction. Unless this is delivered it is difficult to see how 1.5 million new homes will be built over the next five years.   Berry concluded:   One startling omission is the lack of plans to upgrade the existing housing stock. We had been expecting to see a bold plan to retrofit 5m homes to make them greener and more energy efficient but clearly the purse strings have not been opened enough to allow for this. While we should be looking to build more homes we mustn’t take our eye of the existing housing stock, which is the oldest and leakiest in Europe.      2.50pm BST   The king’s speech also announced the nationalisation of railways. Gideon Salutin, senior researcher at the Westminster think tank Social Market Foundation, said;  By nationalising rail and franchising bus services, the new tovernment is finally challenging the historical misalignment of our public and commercial transport objectives. These have never really clicked, with the private sector prioritising areas based on money rather than need, leading availability to crater in many areas. Bus franchising will end the postcode lottery that has seen bus service protected for some and not for others, while rail franchising will allow a more coherent and efficient transit system. Yet key questions remain. Labour has pledged to maintain access to the track for privately owned operators that “add value and capacity to the network” but how that will be determined remains undefined. Further, both rail and bus reforms are unlikely to drastically decrease consumer costs, and with no new money entering the system, those delays and cancellations which have plagued the last government could continue. The new government policy is a bold first move, but it still has miles left to go.  However, Philipp Kurek, arbitration partner at law firm Signature Litigation, warned that the plans could lead to disputes with investors, who may claim compensation. He said:  The government’s plans announced in the King’s Speech today that would allow it to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services will need to be scrutinised carefully to ensure that any renationalisation complies with the UK’s obligations under applicable international investment treaties. The UK is party to more than 100 bilateral investment treaties which provide significant protections to qualifying investors in the UK, including investors (such as shareholders and others with direct or indirect financial interests) in the UK rail infrastructure sector. These treaties contain strict conditions relating to the nationalisation of any protected investment (including an obligation to pay fair market value compensation).  Similarly, a decision by the government not to renew or extend existing contracts when they expire in the coming years may equally give rise to claims for compensation by affected investors.      2.40pm BST   The Federation of Small Businesses was less impressed, saying the king’s speech announcements fell short on measures to stimulate growth for small firms, and jobs within them. The FSB’s policy chair Tina McKenzie said the government’s 105-page briefing document doesn’t mention ‘small business’ once, and the group is now looking to the chancellor Rachel Reeves and her autumn budget to take action.  Today’s King’s Speech announcements fell short on the central challenge – getting growth back into the economy and ensuring wealth creation in every local community.  Apart from ambitious-sounding planning reform, there was no sign of delivery of the small business plan promised by Labour in opposition.  The lack of promised legislation to tackle late payments and poor payment practices by bigger businesses to their small business suppliers is the most serious omission for our community and will hold back economic growth. This scourge hampers cashflow and stifles investment, and we call on the Government to look again and deliver on the promise it made.  The move from an Apprenticeship Levy to a Growth and Skills Levy will risk small business apprenticeships unless the Government quickly follows up with its promised unequivocal commitment to protect Government co-investment for apprenticeships at small employers. Similarly, the Industrial Strategy Council commitment omits mentioning the need for a small business voice, to prevent it being dominated by large corporate incumbent interests. At the same time, small businesses are increasingly worried about the developing employment rights package. More than nine out of ten small employers say they are concerned about the prospect of increased costs and risks when they employ people, and there were no commitments within this to look after small employers who will struggle the most.       2.21pm BST   Here is a round-up of the key points of the king’s speech, in which 40 new bills were announced.   Related: From education and energy to renters and railways: key points from the king’s speech       2.20pm BST   Vicky Parker, head of [ower and itilities at PwC UK, welcomed the Great British Energy bill announced in the king’s. speech today. She said:  The policy direction of the new government suggests we are likely to see a growing involvement of the public sector to help drive progress in energy. The announcement of Great British Energy today and a focus on creating a clean energy superpower, being a welcome example of that to accelerate progress to zero carbon by 2030. The success of these institutions is likely to be measured against the amount of private capital they mobilise, how GBE becomes an active participant in the sector, the introduction of electricity market reforms and their ability to deliver new infrastructure in the UK.  To accelerate plans for the UK to meet net zero, significant investment is required across established solutions, such as wind, as well as less mature solutions such as hydrogen, heat pumps and sustainable aviation fuels. The newly-formed National Wealth Fund’s task force, which has been allocated £7.3bn of capital, will focus on investments such as green hydrogen and steel, industrial decarbonisation, ports and gigafactories. There will still be a gap between what is needed and what the market is currently providing, so a step-up is needed across a wide range of different investor types, as no single solution or institution will provide the full suite of financing which is required. In order to meet the accelerated 2030 targets and demonstrate tangible results, there also needs to be a focus on ramping up the pace of the installation of new, low-carbon infrastructure (generation as well as connection) and tackling long-standing blockers such as planning and financing. Removing planning restrictions and simplifying application processes can unlock offshore wind and accelerate onshore wind development, for example, the latter of which the government has already acted on.      1.14pm BST   The pound is holding onto its gains, climbing by 0.5% and hit $1.3044 earlier, its strongest level against the dollar in a year.  The UK currency was boosted by higher-than-expected UK inflation data, which led to markets paring back expectations of an interest rate cut in August. Before the data, they were almost 50-50; now the probability of a rate cut is seen at 36%.

Investors are attracted by political stability, following the Labour party’s decisive election victory on 4 July. In France, the centrist prime minister Gabriel Attal and his government resigned on Tuesday, but stayed on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is appointed. The leftwing coalition that won France’s snap election on 7 July is struggling to form a government.

Other European indices are also trading lower, with Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC down about 0.7% while the Italian borsa slid by 0.4%.     12.22pm BST   Rachel Delacour, chief executive and founder of sustainability management firm Sweep,which works with the energy firm SSE and others, welcomed the government’s plans to establish Great British Energy and invest billions in renewables, as mentioned in today’s king’s speech.  GB Energy will be headquartered in Scotland, where much of the UK’s oil and gas and offshore wind industries are based). She said this is “a major step in the right direction for the UK’s journey towards net zero”. She added  All organisations need to tackle their greenhouse gas emissions, and governments creating the conditions for them to access cleaner energy is a key part of the puzzle.  However, it is crucial that the government puts the appropriate structure in place around a project of this size. This means monitoring it through stringent data collection processes, understanding the impact Great British Energy will have on the environment itself, and providing its users – especially businesses – with the detailed insights needed to reduce carbon emissions. It is only through taking such measures that Great British Energy can truly monitor its impact across the UK and support UK businesses to meet science-based climate targets.      12.17pm BST   Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said:  King’s Speech, no surprises, but no details either. The King said that his government would Get Britain building through planning reform as they seek to accelerate the delivery of high quality infrastructure and housing through a Planning and Infrastructure Bill. There was no mention of targets, no 1.5m homes, and no mention of social housing ‘percentages’, suggesting that Labour will take a pragmatic approach to social and affordable housing supply.  However, we expect that Labour will push ahead with its plan to build 1.5m homes over the next five years and do all it can to the planning system to help get Britain building. We expect the housebuilders shares to re-rate as the Labour Policies move from manifesto pledges to policy action. Renters will be happy that no fault evictions will be banned, and homeowners will welcome the plans to reform leasehold and commonholds.      12.14pm BST   The king’s Speech has set out plans to “start mending broken public services,” says the union Unison. Its general secretary Christina McAnea said:  These bills are the start of the long process to mend much of what’s been broken by Conservative governments and generate the growth to get public services thriving once more. Labour’s workplace rights package promises to be a game changer. For too long, bad bosses have had it all their own way. The new deal is a chance to reset the dial in favour of good employers and every UK worker and jobseeker. Outdated practices like ‘fire and rehire’ and zero-hours are to be consigned to history in a move that’s understandably proved popular with voters from across the political spectrum. Social care gets some attention at last too. After years of government neglect, the fair pay agreement is the first sign things are set to change, with a national care service the ultimate prize. Once the new pay agreement is in place, wages in care will rise across England, easing the sector’s staffing nightmare and relieving pressure on the NHS. The government’s growth agenda is closely linked to devolved regional and local services, yet many councils are teetering on the brink of effective bankruptcy.  Devolving powers and reforming planning regimes can only help generate growth if local government receives sustainable, long-term funding and is able to retain expert staff.      12.11pm BST   Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pension schemes bill, announced in the king’s speech, is good news, bringing simplicity and greater flexibility, something that the financial services firm has been calling for.  Boosting retirement outcomes through a leaner, more efficient system is at its heart. Government estimates that the introduction of these measures could boost the average person’s pension pot by 9% over the course of their career. With recent data from HL’s Savings and Resilience Barometer showing only 38% of households are on track for a moderate retirement such changes are vital. There are measures in place aimed at dealing with the lingering ‘lost pots’ problem with deferred pots being automatically brought together in one place. Keeping track of every pension can mean people enter retirement with a better view of exactly how much they have and this can significantly improve retirement decision making. Ensuring we can build on the small pots plan and use the infrastructure to support a Lifetime Pension will be essential to stop the flow of small pots and allow for people who change jobs frequently to take control of their retirement planning. Allowing people to choose their pension provider will also have benefits for engagement and improve market competition based on which schemes support people and their retirements the best. Schemes will also be under pressure to prove they are offering value for money through the introduction of a standardised test. How metrics related to cost, returns, service and member engagement will be crucial here. Value for money should also drive consolidation within the pensions market amounting to a smaller number of much larger defined contribution schemes. The shift towards consolidation across both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes is expected to bring more efficiencies and lower costs. It will also boost the ability for UK pension schemes to invest in more productive assets – a key goal for government which can not only boost pension scheme growth and people’s retirement incomes - but also that of the UK economy.

Creating wealth in every community.National renewal starts now. pic.twitter.com/SznttCF8Cu— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) July 17, 2024   Updated at 12.12pm BST    12.07pm BST   Pete Mugleston, managing director of the website onlinemortgageadvisor, has also looked at the housing measures:  In light of the recent King’s Speech by the Labour government, the proposed housing policies signify a turning point for the UK housing market. By addressing long-standing issues and introducing new initiatives, the Labour government hopes to reinvigorate the sector. Labour’s plan to build 1.5m homes and have mandatory housing targets for councils over the next five years is encouraging. Increasing the housing supply can help alleviate the intense competition that often drives up property prices. By expanding the availability of homes, the government aims to create a more balanced market where buyers have more choices, reducing the pressures homeowners often feel with aggressive bidding and overpaying. This new policy can also stimulate business spending and attract foreign investment, leading to job creation and a more robust economy in the future.  Turning to renters, he said:  One of the most significant elements of the King’s Speech is Labour’s plans to protect renters’ rights by reintroducing the Renters Reform Bill. Central to this bill is empowering renters to challenge “unreasonable” rent increases. This is welcome news for many renters in the UK who are currently dealing with the cost of living crisis, where their rent has increased more than their wages. For those looking to buy houses, these reforms have the potential to bring much-needed relief. By increasing the housing supply across the country these policies could stabilise or even lower property prices, making homeownership more attainable for many first-time homeowners. Pair this with inflation holding steady at 2% this month, it could indicate to the Bank of England to finally lower interest rates from 5.2%. ‘This should make mortgages more affordable and reduce homeowners’ monthly payments helping to ease the financial burden for many.      12.03pm BST   Here is some instant reaction to the king’s speech. Nigel Bishop of Recoco Property Search said:   Labour’s announcement to levy VAT on private school fees has been labelled one of the party’s more controversial ones. This will leave many parents unable to afford private school education and inevitably impact on the property market by boosting demand for properties in close proximity to good state schools. Properties in these catchment areas can already ask a 20% premium and a politically-caused boost in demand for such homes will create an even more competitive market for buyers. Labour’s manifesto pledged to improve the UK’s housing market and the party is under immense pressure to deliver. One promise was to build 1.5 million homes and we are interested to learn more about Labour’s plans to utilise “poor quality” green belt areas as this will likely be met by protests from some local residents and organisations.      12.02pm BST   Britain’s new centre-left government said it will help the country move on from a cost-of-living crisis by focusing on wealth creation, as it set out its plans for the coming year.  A speech written by the Labour government and delivered in parliament by King Charles III said Labour will get more houses and infrastructure projects built, strengthen workers’ rights and create a new industrial strategy.  The king said the goal is to “see rising living standards in all nations and regions of the United Kingdom.”  Labour won the UK’s general election on 4 July by a landslide, with voters keen to see change after 14 years of Conservative Party rule.

The government hopes to plug the hole with additional tax revenues when the economy picks up. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, skirted a recession at the start of the year but growth has been slower than expected. Germany’s budget for next year includes a record €78bn of investments and net borrowing of €43.8bn, and an economic package aimed at reviving growth. The budget totals €481bn, and complies with a constitutionally enshrined cap on spending, known as the debt brake. German finance minister Christian Lindner said today:  We are complying with the debt brake, which makes us an anchor of stability in Europe. With our growth initiative, we are providing important economic policy impetus to make Germany more attractive as a business location. New room for manoeuvre in the budget can only be created through more economic growth.  A year before Germany’s next federal election, and ahead of regional elections in September, reaching agreement on the budget has been a major test for the coalition government made of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats, the Greens and the liberals (FDP). In June’s European election, the ruling parties fared poorly, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came second behind the conservatives.     11.41am BST   Here are the main drivers behind UK inflation holding at 2% in June:  Interactive UK inflation drivers      11.14am BST  Eurozone inflation dips to 2.5%  In the eurozone, annual inflation dipped to 2.5% in June from 2.6% in May. A year earlier, the rate was 5.5%, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The lowest annual inflation rates were registered in Finland (0.5%), Italy (0.9%) and Lithuania (1.0%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Belgium (5.4%), Romania (5.3%), Spain and Hungary (both 3.6%).  The highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate came from services, followed by food, alcohol & tobacco, non-energy industrial goods and energy.     10.20am BST  Sterling rises by 0.5% to one-year high; stock markets slip  The pound has risen by 0.5% to $1.3032, its highest level since mid-July last year, after the higher-than-expected UK inflation figures, which analysts said diminished the chances of an August rate cut.

There is clearly a reset and people are looking at the UK with fresh eyes. The economy seems to be moving in the right direction and we are handling higher rates a lot better than expected despite the relatively strong transmission of monetary policy vs the US. That strong transmission should work in our favour when the BoE does start to cut…maybe the Bank is mindful that there is a lot of pent up energy in the old bulldog yet and it’s going be careful about unleashing it.      8.53am BST   Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, has looked at this morning’s main developments in the UK:  Inflation figures released this morning show the Consumer Prices Index holding at 2% for the second month in succession. The headline figure will be welcomed in Downing Street, but the Bank of England is likely to be concerned that the pace of inflation in dervices remains stubbornly high at 5.7%, also unchanged on the month.  Services inflation had been predicted to fall this month and its failure to do so could well leave the Bank’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee wary of making any early reductions in UK rates…. suggesting good news for savers, but more pain for mortgage holders who may have to wait longer to see their monthly payments start to ease.  Turning to the king’s speech at 11.30am BST, he said:  King Charles will deliver the second King’s Speech of his reign later today, on behalf of the new Labour Government. Around 35 laws are set to be outlined as PM Starmer’s government unveils its plan to ‘take the brakes off Britain’. Key measures expected in the speech include a new planning bill, which will make it harder for councils to block development and powers forcing them to identify development land in their areas.  More devolution in England will see mayoral powers increased, whilst GB Energy will be set up to drive de-carbonisation of the power grid with an £8.3bn budget to kick-start projects. Not everything will be new; bills tabled previously by the Conservatives but not yet enacted, like the phased ban on smoking are set to be put back onto the government’s agenda too.  Babcock, the aerospace, defence and engineering company, said that it has seen a further deterioration in its performance under a contract to build five Type 31 frigates for the Royal Navy. The company is setting aside a further £90m provision, taken against upcoming full year results. The provision relates to expected future wage costs. The contract had allowed for wages rising in line with the consumer price index, but Babcock is finding that labour simply can’t be found in sufficient quantities at the wage rates built into the contract.  The company also reports that Type 31 aside, underlying profits are sharply higher, and the improving state of its pension fund will allow future top-up contributions by the company to be £25m a year lower.  HSBC has announced that Georges Elhedery, a long-time HSBC staffer, most recently serving as its chief financial officer, has been appointed to the top slot, replacing outgoing CEO Noel Quinn whose departure was announced a few weeks ago. Elhedery, a graduate of the Paris’s Ecole Polytechnique and the ENSAE, takes up his new role in September.

At about 11.30am, shortly after leading the royal procession into the House of Lords and hopping on to his throne, King Charles will set out the new government’s agenda, writes my colleague Archie Bland. With Labour’s manifesto plan for mandatory housing targets at the heart of it, it’s probably going to be short on surprises. But it will start to flesh out the detail of how Keir Starmer intends to govern – and whether his party’s swollen backbench numbers might bring headaches as well as parliamentary security.

The contribution from the food and services categories should decline gradually as firms pass on the gains from their lower energy bills. However, the drag from falling energy prices will start to fade from July, and this is likely to mean that headline inflation temporarily drifts up towards the end of this year. But the bigger picture is one where the inflation pressure of the past three years has dissipated, and the EY Item Club expects a period of relatively low and stable inflation to underpin steady improvements in household spending power.  The minutes of last month’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting made it clear that the committee is split, he said.  The more hawkish members may see today’s data as evidence that their concerns about inflation persistence are well founded. The implications for the more dovish members are unclear. On the one hand, they indicated they were becoming less interested in backward-looking measures of inflation persistence and were adopting a more forward-looking approach. And that shift had occurred despite a string of overshoots for services inflation.  But on the other hand, from a presentational point of view, they might feel that they need to wait for inflation to surprise on the downside before they move. A hawkish response from markets to today’s data might also encourage the MPC to wait.

Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said:  For the majority of the MPC [ monetary policy committee], today’s inflation report won’t be as encouraging as it may have anticipated. Undoubtedly, today’s services print raises the bar for an August rate cut. But there is a key caveat here. With live music and accommodation prices rising at such speed, the MPC could potentially be minded to look past some of the upside in services inflation.  To be sure, we now think that an August rate cut is finely balanced. A lot will now depend on the strength of the May wage and unemployment data.

The services surprise was narrow this month, focused in accommodation services which rose 3.3% month-to-month, well above our forecast, 0.5%, which we suspect was close to the consensus forecast. We assume some of this was driven by surging demand due to live music events, with prices for the latter also rising sharply, by 7.5% year-over-year.  That said, we had thought hotel prices would surge more if the ONS collected CPI on June 18—when Taylor Swift held an event in Cardiff—rather than June 11, which is when the ONS did collect prices. The surge in hotel prices is no doubt erratic, but there may also be some more underlying strength in that component than we assumed. Also supporting services inflation were rents rising 7.2% year-over-year in June, up from 7.0% in May and other services inflation ticking up to 5.2% year-over-year from 5.1% as we expected. Elsewhere services inflation eased mostly as expected but remained strong.   Turning to the outlook for inflation, he said:  We expect inflation to rise to 2.2% in July as utility prices fall less this year than in July 2023. Looking further ahead, food and non-energy goods inflation have no further to fall now they have converged to producer output price inflation while Ofgem will likely hike the utility price cap by 12% in October after wholesale energy costs have risen. Those components have accounted for almost all—9.0 percentage points—of CPI inflation’s 9.1pp fall since October 2022. Their contribution to year-over-year CPI inflation will rise 86bp by December. Getting inflation sustainably back to the 2% target will require services inflation to drop closer to 3.5%, but that will take time because wage growth remains strong. We look for CPI services inflation to fall only to 4.9% at the end of 2024.   Updated at 8.07am BST    7.58am BST  HSBC appoints finance chief Georges Elhedery as new CEO  HSBC has named its finance chief Georges Elhedery as chief executive to replace 37-year veteran Noel Quinn. Elhedery, who will take on the role in September, has been promoted to the role after becoming its chief financial officer in January 2023. Sir Mark Tucker, the bank’s chair, said that Elhedery was the outstanding candidate and had a track record of “driving growth, delivering simplification and containing costs”. The appointment comes after Quinn unexpectedly announced that he was stepping down from the role after an “intense” five-year period. He will step down officially on 2 September but will remain available to the group until his gardening leave period ends on 30 April 2025. Elhedery will continue as CFO during this transition period. Elhedery began at HSBC in 2005 and has held roles as the of co-chief executive in HSBC’s global banking and markets division, while also leading the bank’s Middle Eastern, north Africa and Turkiye regional business between 2016 and 2019. Tucker said:   During his career he has worked in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Since joining the board as group chief financial officer in early 2023 and throughout the selection process, he has demonstrated his strategic insight and vision, and deep international perspectives.  The appointment comes after HSBC reported an 1.8% drop in pre-tax profit to $12.7bn (£10.1bn) in the first three months of 2024, better than analysts had forecast. Revenues increased by 3% to $20.8bn.     7.53am BST  Pound rises closer to $1.30 level  The pound has now risen by 0.16% against the dollar to $1.2986, edging closer to the $1.30 level. It is also up by 0.1% versus the euro, at €1.1911. Isaac Stell, investment manager at the Wealth Club, said:  Inflation in June was slightly ahead of expectations, but remains at the Bank of England’s target. The largest upward impact came from restaurants and hotels in a month where Taylor Swift has been touring the UK. The Swift effect remains a global phenomenon, and could well find its way into future economic textbooks. Eyes will now turn to the Bank of England’s meeting on the 1st August and the next interest rate decision. On target inflation may increase appetite for a rate cut, but core inflation looks less promising, muddying the water particularly around the stickier services inflation numbers, and making an August cut look increasingly unlikely. The pound has edged up marginally this morning, in a sign that currency markets at least don’t think rates will be cut in the short term.   Updated at 8.23am BST    7.45am BST  Economists say high services inflation lowers chance of August rate cut  Other economists also say that the data lowers the chances of an interest rate cut in August. Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said:  The Bank will be relieved that headline inflation has remained at target in June in line with their expectations. That relief will be tempered though by services inflation holding at 5.7%, well above their expectations. Stickiness in services inflation – a key measure of domestic inflationary pressures – lowers the likelihood of an August rate reduction. All eyes will be on tomorrow’s wage data to see whether it will spur a summer rate cut by the MPC. Inflation is likely to rise slightly in the coming months, as energy price inflation picks up reinforcing sticky services inflation. But all being well, inflation should moderate further out, supporting a downward trend in interest rates.  Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said:  Headline inflation is in retreat and is running well below rates in the US and the euro area. Much of this decline reflects the effects of high food and energy prices dropping out of the numbers. Stripping those components out, UK core inflation is running at an uncomfortable 3.5%, above rates in the US and the euro area. A pick up in UK activity since the start of the year means that the service sector is generating quite high levels of inflation. That suggests the Bank of England has limited scope to cut rates this year.   Updated at 7.53am BST    7.40am BST   Dales explained:  By staying at 5.7% in June, services inflation remained well above the 5.1% rate in June that the Bank of England forecast back in May. Admittedly, a lot of that overshoot happened in April and May. And that didn’t stop the BoE from sounding a bit dovish at the subsequent June policy meeting.  Even so, the BoE expected services inflation to fall 0.2 percentage points in June, which didn’t happen. And only some of the stickiness of services inflation in June may be due to the influence of Taylor Swift’s concerts. They may have been behind some of the large rise in hotels inflation from 7.0% to 9.8%. But cultural services inflation, which would capture any influence from the ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. As a result, it’s not obvious that the BoE can ignore a chunk of the stickiness of services inflation.      7.37am BST   Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:  Even though consumer prices index inflation stayed exactly in line with the 2.0% target in June, it’s the stability of services inflation at 5.7% that’s the blow. And it looks as though only a small part of that may have been due to the temporary effects of Taylor Swift’s concerts. As a result, the chances of an interest rate cut in August have diminished a bit more.   Updated at 7.53am BST    7.34am BST  Economists talk of Taylor Swift effect on prices  Taylor Swift may have put pressure on UK inflation as fans splashed out on costly concert tickets, hotels and meals out. The American singer toured Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London in June. However, economists say that the Bank of England is likely to be more worried about sticky services inflation, which remained at an annual rate of 5.7% in June. Wage data tomorrow should shed further light on these price pressures. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at the investment firm abrdn, said:  Today’s inflation report will keep the Bank of England’s August rate decision on a knife edge. The strength of hotel price growth is suggestive of a so-called Taylor Swift effect on prices, but policy makers will almost certainly look through this kind of dynamic. More fundamentally, the ongoing stickiness of services inflation will leave the Bank wondering how long inflation will stay at the 2% target once favourable base effects have passed and domestic price pressures start to drive headline inflation again. Tomorrow’s wage data will provide more clues about these price pressures, and the Bank will hope to see a further moderation in wage growth. For now, we continue to expect a rate cut in August, but this will require the upcoming data to cooperate.   Updated at 7.49am BST    7.22am BST   In May, inflation hit the Bank of England’s target of 2% for the first time in nearly three years. Financial markets see a near-50% chance of a rate cut at the central bank’s next meeting on 1 August. The pound rose slightly on the higher-than-expected inflation data, and is trading at $1.2977. It has gained nearly 2% against the dollar this year. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said:  The data showed that inflation in Britain stagnated in June versus the expectation of a further easing. And higher-than-expected figures cooled down the expectation of an August rate cut from the Bank of England. But because the September Fed rate cut is already fully priced in, there is still room for a dovish BoE pricing into late summer – which means that we shall still see a limited upside potential in Cable: the $1.30 level could be hard to clear.   Updated at 7.53am BST    7.16am BST  Introduction: UK inflation stays at 2% in June  Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. It’s inflation day in the UK today. The headline annual inflation rate stayed at 2% in June, unchanged from May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Analysts had expected a further dip to 1.9%. Inflation was last lower than this in April 2021, when it stood at 1.5%. On a monthly basis, the consumer prices index rose by 0.1% in June from May. The largest upward contribution to inflation came from restaurants and hotels, where prices of hotels rose more than a year ago; the largest downward contribution came from clothing and footwear, with prices of garments falling this year having risen a year ago. The core rate of inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, stayed at 3.5%.  Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew 2.0% in the year to June 2024, unchanged from the previous month.Read the release ➡️ https://t.co/xCG9DNmbkX pic.twitter.com/xVbi2oFTel— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) July 17, 2024  The inflation figures will be the last the Bank of England sees before it decides on 1 August whether to cut interest rates from their current level of 5.25%. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said:  It is welcome that inflation is at target, but we know that for families across Britain prices remain high. We face the legacy of fourteen years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this Government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.

      "Rail unions have said Britain’s trains will be “run as a public service, not for private profit”, as the new government announced early steps to renationalise the railways in the king’s speech. Labour will renationalise rail with two separate bills, decoupling laws to take train services into public ownership from more complex legislation to set up a dedicated public body, Great British Railways (GBR). Rail leaders and unions welcomed the announcement of a long-awaited overhaul of the industry – although private train operators warned nationalisation could increase costs, as their exit from the industry was confirmed alongside a slew of new transport legislation announced in Wednesday’s king’s speech. The government said that public ownership would be the “default position” for train operators, while bus services could also be owned and controlled by local councils under other legislation. The passenger railway services (public ownership) bill will overturn the status quo, under which four of the 14 national train operators are being run by a state-owned “operator of last resort”, which only takes over after a private firm’s failure. Services will return into state hands as remaining contracts expire over the coming years – or possibly earlier if lawyers advise of potential grounds for breach of contract. Avanti West Coast bosses were put on notice to improve performance in a meeting with the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, on Tuesday. A separate railways bill will establish GBR in a similar way to the reform proposed under the Conservatives in 2021, creating a “directing mind” running a “unified and simplified” rail system, with track and train managed by the same organisation. Private open access train operators – such as Hull Trains or Lumo – which offer a service run by a firm specialising in a single route, will continue where a specific route is deemed to add value and capacity. Some of rail’s immediate problems, including the industrial relations breakdown that has plagued Avanti and others, may be ameliorated by measures in Labour’s employment rights bill – marking a swift end to Conservative plans for minimum service levels during strikes. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said the union welcomed the announcements on trade unions and public ownership, adding: “We will actively engage with the government on the pay issues in our sectors which can be resolved quickly.” Mick Whelan, the general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said renationalisation was “the right decision, at the right time … an end to the failed fragmentation of our network”. He said the railway would now be “run as a public service, not for private profit”. Darren Caplan, the head of the trade body the Railway Industry Association, said it was “a strong legislative programme for driving growth” and said GBR’s “strategic oversight and responsibility for rail can focus on meeting growing passenger demand and boosting industry revenues”. Rail Partners, which represents private train operators, said the commitment to create GBR was “an important milestone”. However, its chief executive, Andy Bagnall, added: “Full nationalisation is a political not a practical solution, which will increase costs over time.” The high-speed rail (Crewe-Manchester) bill was carried over from the previous government – although the government stressed it would not overturn Rishi Sunak’s controversial axing of the northern leg of HS2. Retaining the bill allows progress on parts of HS2 that intersected with the proposed “Northern Powerhouse Rail” line across the north without further legislative delay. Public ownership of buses will also be a possibility under new laws. The better buses bill will extend franchising powers from metro mayors to all local authorities, and remove the bar on contracting municipal bus companies to operate routes. The government said it would enable local leaders to deliver bus networks reflecting the needs of their communities and give councils more control over funding. A fourth transport bill will establish a “revenue certainty mechanism” for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a measure sought by the airline industry and investors, to help pave the way to build plants making SAF in Britain. Despite the scepticism from environmental groups, SAF is championed by airlines as the best short-term tool – if not the only one, bar flying less – to decarbonise their operations. Labour also hopes the nascent industry will bring thousands of jobs.\n",
      "HSBC has named its finance chief, Georges Elhedery, as its new chief executive, handing the reins to an international bank veteran as the global lender steels itself for fresh tensions between the US and China.  Elhedery, who will take on the post in September, will replace Noel Quinn, who in April made the unexpected announcement that he was stepping down after an “intense” five years in charge. It continues a long tradition of HSBC appointing insiders to the top role, including Quinn, who began his career in 1987 at the bank which was previously known as the Midland. Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and has held roles including co-chief executive of its global banking and markets division, and head of HSBC’s operations in the Middle East, north Africa and Turkey regional business between 2016 and 2019. He was hired at the bank after a four-year stint at Goldman Sachs in the early 2000s, having launched his career with Banque Paribas in Tokyo in 1997. His latest promotion as HSBC chief executive comes just 18 months after he took over as chief financial officer in January last year. HSBC said Elhedery’s appointment was the result of an “orderly and robust succession process”, which also considered external candidates. Its chair, Mark Tucker, who led the search, said Elhedery was the “outstanding candidate” who had a record of “driving growth, delivering simplification and containing costs”. The Lebanese-born and Mandarin-speaking banker was also praised by bosses for his “deep international perspectives”, which are likely to come into play as he navigates fresh tension between the Washington and Beijing. The bank, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, will be sensitive to any aggressive rhetoric from Donald Trump if the former president and his recently selected running mate JD Vance win the US leadership race in November. “We look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth,” Tucker said of Elhedery’s appointment. Quinn will continue to lead HSBC over the next six-and-a-half weeks and remain on call to help with Elhedery’s transition until the current chief executive’s gardening leave period comes to an end on 30 April next year.  The announcement comes two weeks before HSBC reveals its second-quarter results, which could reveal concerns over weaker growth in China, as well as the start of a rate-cutting cycle that would put pressure on the bank’s net interest income. However, a rebound in demand for investment banking services, which has buoyed Wall Street rivals, could help offset some of those concerns. HSBC reported a 1.8% drop in pre-tax profit to $12.7bn (£10.1bn) in the first three months of 2024, better than analysts had forecast, allowing it to hand more cash back to investors. Revenues increased by 3% to $20.8bn over the first quarter. Quinn’s departure will end five years at the top of HSBC, having been promoted on an interim basis after the ousting of the previous boss John Flint, who was in place for just 18 months. In that period, Quinn navigated the bank through the pandemic and slashed 35,000 jobs to save £3.5bn a year. He also fended off demands from the top shareholder Ping An to split off HSBC’s lucrative Asian business, and managed to partly appease critics by selling off and shrinking some global operations, including in Canada and France. Elhedery’s promotion will come with a generous pay package, made up of a base salary of £1.38m a year, a fixed allowance of £1.7m and a pension allowance of £137,600. Elhedery will also be eligible for an annual bonus worth up to 215% of his base salary, and a long-term incentive award scheme worth 320% of his salary. Elhedery said: “Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory.” • This article was amended on 17 July 2024. An earlier version misspelled the first name of Georges Elhedery as “George”.\n",
      "Inflation is back down to more normal levels. But at the Bank of England, there are concerns that the battle to keep it close to the 2% target set by the government has yet to be decisively won. Official figures from June show the headline measure remained bang on target for a second month in a row, raising hopes that the worst of the inflationary burst after the exit from Covid lockdowns and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has passed. After the Bank hiked interest rates 14 times, to 5.25% – the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis – to fight inflation, there have been hopes for some time that a return to more normal levels could warrant a cut in official borrowing costs.   Related: Hopes of August rate cut fall after UK inflation stays at 2%   Having come down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, signs of stability in consumer price growth will come as welcome relief to households and businesses. However, the cost of living still remains significantly higher than three years ago, and the Bank is worried that inflation will bump back above its target within months. Of most concern to Threadneedle Street will be signs of stubborn inflationary pressure in the services sector – one of the key areas the Bank has said it closely monitors when considering whether to sanction a rate cut. The latest figures showed services inflation held steady at 5.7%, a blow for those advocating a cut. The ONS said three main sub-sectors were contributing to the sticky levels of price growth: restaurants and cafes, rents and hotels. Some economists said this could be down to Taylor Swift’s Eras tour landing in Britain last month, triggering a boom in demand for hotels and other consumer-facing services as Swifties flocked to concert venues across the UK. For stubborn inflation, read: “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me?” The ONS isn’t so sure. The government statisticians logged many of the prices in their dataset before the concerts took place, while its samples were taken from hotels across the country, not just in places where Taylormania had taken hold. There may have been some evidence of Swift’s impact in inflation in hotels, where average price growth rose from 7% in May to 9.8% in June. But cultural services inflation, which would capture ticket prices, dipped from 7.4% to 7.3%. Financial markets are, however, taking a cue that domestic inflationary pressures could prove more persistent than hoped. The chances of the Bank cutting rates at its next policy meeting on 1 August have slipped from about 50% to close to 35%, while the pound strengthened to a one-year high, breaking through $1.30 on the global currency markets. Several members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, including its chief economist, Huw Pill, have warned in the past week that service sector inflation and a tight jobs market could force Threadneedle Street to take a cautious approach. Official figures from the jobs market are due to be published on Thursday, giving the central bank plenty of time to come up with a view before its next meeting. Some economists, however, believe that when it comes to signs of inflation persistence in the service sector, the Bank should shake it off. Goods prices, and in particular durable goods prices, remain firmly in deflation. Producer price inflation – reflecting factory gate prices, which can act as a guide to future consumer prices – was also weaker than expected. With concerns that high interest rates are weighing heavily on the economy and households unnecessarily, there will be growing demands for a cut in borrowing costs.\n",
      "Pernod Ricard has agreed to sell off the majority of its international wine brands, including Jacob’s Creek and Campo Viejo, as the drinks company aims to focus on its spirits and champagne business. The Paris-based company, which is known for selling spirits such as Absolut vodka and Beefeater gin, said it was selling its wine brands produced in Australia, Spain and New Zealand to the owner of Australia’s Accolade Wines. Pernod did not disclose how much it was receiving from selling the brands to Australian Wine Holdco Ltd (AWL) but said the products sold 10m cases a year.   Related: Low alcohol sales boom ahead of Euros final   It said the sale, which is expected to complete in the second half of 2025, would allow it to redirect its resources to its premium spirits and champagne brands. Pernod Ricard is among the world’s largest wine and spirits sellers, with its brands including Havana Club rum, Jameson Irish whiskey and Perrier-Jouet champagne. It competes globally with the UK’s Diageo, the owner of the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff brands. It posted more than £10bn in sales last year, and recorded an operating profit of £2.8bn. Wine sales made up just 4% of this, a 2% fall on the previous year. The sale will also include the brands Orlando and St Hugo, from Australia; Stoneleigh, Brancott Estate and Church Road from New Zealand; and Ysios, Tarsus and Azpilicueta, which are produced in Spain. Pernod will retain its US and French wine brands, as well as labels in Argentina and China. The Accolade Wines owner AWL is a consortium of institutional investors with backers including the private equity firm Bain Capital. Last year, the fund bought Accolade Wines, Australia’s second largest producer, after it struggled to adapt to new Chinese tariffs and consumers shifting away from lower-priced wine brands. A Pernod Ricard statement said: “We will sell our wine division to a player of global scale, with a route to market solely dedicated to the wine industry. “Our wine brands will benefit from the focus required to achieve their potential, reinforce their position, and seize new opportunities around the world.” Joshua Hartz, a spokesperson for AWL, said: “Backed by AWL, the combined business will be better able to adapt to changing consumer tastes and meet the structural challenges facing the global wine industry.”\n",
      "The chances of an August interest rate cut have taken a blow after a sharp jump in hotel prices meant progress in the UK’s fight against inflation stalled last month. A near 9% jump in the cost of a hotel room – blamed by some analysts on a “Taylor Swift effect” – offset the impact of cut-price clothing to leave the government’s preferred measure of the cost of living at its 2% target for a second month in a row in June. With measures of underlying inflation also holding steady, the City said the prospect of the Bank of England reducing the cost of borrowing from its current level of 5.25% at its next meeting on 1 August had diminished. Financial markets trimmed their forecasts for the likelihood of an August cut down from a 50% to a 35% chance on Wednesday after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the inflation data. The pound rose above $1.30 against the US dollar on the currency markets for the first time in a year amid expectations that rates would remain on hold until September or even November.  Interactive    Related: UK inflation stays at 2%, defying forecasts of a further dip; pound hits $1.30 – business live   The ONS figures showed core inflation – which excludes food, energy, alcoholic drinks and tobacco – was unchanged at 3.5%. Inflation in the services sector – closely watched by the Bank of England – remained steady at 5.7%, higher than the 5.1% expected by Threadneedle Street. Hotel prices rose by 8.8% annually in June, compared with a much smaller rise of 1.7% a year earlier. Analysts suggested this jump was partly generated by demand for stays around last month’s eight UK dates of Taylor Swift’s global Eras tour. Isaac Stell, an investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: “Inflation in June was slightly ahead of expectations but remains at the Bank of England’s target. The largest upward impact came from restaurants and hotels in a month where Taylor Swift has been touring the UK. The Swift effect remains a global phenomenon and could well find its way into future economic textbooks.” Luke Bartholomew, the deputy chief economist at the fund manager Abrdn, said: “Today’s inflation report will keep the Bank of England’s August rate decision on a knife-edge. The strength of hotel price growth is suggestive of a Taylor Swift effect on prices, but policymakers will almost certainly look through this kind of dynamic.” However, other analysts said the ONS had collected prices for the June inflation report before the bulk of Swift’s tour dates. Paul Dales, of Capital Economics, said: “Even though CPI inflation stayed exactly in line with the 2.0% target in June … it’s the stability of services inflation at 5.7% that’s the blow. And it looks as though only a small part of that may have been due to the temporary effects of Taylor Swift’s concerts. As a result, the chances of an interest rate cut in August have diminished a bit more.” Although the consensus in the financial markets had been for a fall to 1.9% last month as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), the ONS said inflation was still at its joint lowest level in nearly three years. The annual increase in the cost of living was last lower in April 2021, when it stood at 1.5%. Prices overall rose by 0.1% last month, matching the increase in the same month of 2023. Food price inflation continued to ease, dropping from 1.7% to 1.5%, while clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.6% in the year to June compared with 3% in the year to May. Hotel and restaurant inflation rose from 5.8% to 6.3%. Threadneedle Street’s rate setters on its nine-strong monetary policy committee expect inflation to rise to 2.5% in the second half of 2024 before falling back below the official 2% target. The ONS chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said: “Hotel prices rose strongly while secondhand car costs fell but by less than this time last year. However, these were offset by falling clothing prices, with widespread sales driving down their cost.” Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “It is welcome that inflation is at target, but we know that for families across Britain prices remain high. We face the legacy of 14 years of chaos and economic irresponsibility. That is why this government is taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off.” George Dibb, the associate director for economic policy at left-leaning thinktank the IPPR, said: “Today’s data confirms that inflation is well on its way towards normalisation. Some inflation drivers, such as core inflation, are still elevated, but the Bank of England’s policy stance remains too tight. Interest rates have been too high for too long and need to come down to not hamper growth.”\n",
      "The Body Shop is close to being bought out of administration after it agreed to exclusive rescue talks with a consortium led by the British cosmetics tycoon Mike Jatania. Jatania’s investment company, Auréa, is in negotiations with the UK cosmetic chain’s administrators over a deal. The Body Shop fell into administration in February, leading to hundreds of job losses and more than 80 shop closures. Charles Denton, the former chief executive of the beauty brand Molton Brown, will lead the new management team if a deal is struck. A joint statement by Auréa and the administrators, FRP Advisory, said that after a competitive bidding process Jatania’s company had begun carrying out due diligence checks, with a sale expected to be agreed in the coming weeks. It said: “While the deal is not yet complete, we believe the combined experience of the consortium, together with the existing management team, represents the best outcome for creditors and will ultimately ensure the long-term success of The Body Shop.” The Body Shop was founded by the late environmental and human rights campaigner Anita Roddick in 1976 and became a staple of the British high street, selling ethically produced cosmetic and skincare products. In February it went into administration after its owner, Aurelius, which had bought the company for £207m three months earlier, said it could not revive the business’s fortunes. It owed creditors more than £276m at the time. Administrators have since closed 82 shops, leaving 116 open, while 489 shop jobs and 270 office jobs have been cut. Last week, Bloomberg reported that administrators were close to striking a deal with Auréa after it beat rival bidders at auction. Auréa is led by Jatania and the former UBS group banker Paul Raphael and Pharmapacks founder Andrew Vagenas. It owns brands including Herbivore Botanicals a plant-based cosmetics firm; Scandinavian Biolabs, a natural haircare product; and Decypher, which produces and sells foundation makeup. Jatania previously ran Lornamead, which owned personal care brands including Lypsyl, Woods of Windsor, Yardley and Harmony haircare. He sold it to a rival, Li & Fung, for about £155m more than 10 years ago.\n",
      "Harland & Wolff, the owner of the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic, has insisted that it is still awaiting a government decision on a £200m intervention despite signs that Labour is due to reject the financial lifeline. The company is presenting an early test of the Labour government’s industrial policy, with 1,500 workers fearful the company is running out of time to secure funding needed to make it ready to build three warships for the Royal Navy. Harland & Wolff (H&W) was forced to suspend its London-listed shares a fortnight ago, and it has missed two deadlines to file audited accounts, raising questions over its finances and its ability to fulfil a £1.6bn contract to build the three fleet solid support ships that will carry supplies such as ammunition and food to the navy’s aircraft carriers. The government, under the Conservative party, had provisionally agreed a deal to 100% underwrite a £200m loan by a consortium of lenders to Harland & Wolff to allow it to refinance its debts. The company on Tuesday said it had reduced its request for the guarantee from 100% to 80%, and that it had presented legal opinions showing that a guarantee would not violate state aid rules. However, the Financial Times reported that Labour had decided that giving the guarantee would be an inappropriate use of government funds, citing an unnamed Whitehall source saying: “Giving the loan guarantee would be deeply irresponsible.” The company has been investing heavily to recruit a workforce of 1,500 across the Belfast site, plus yards at Appledore in Devon, and Methil and Arnish in Scotland. It plans to split work on the fleet solid support vessels across the yards, while working in a consortium with Spain’s state-owned Navantia. H&W said that the former chancellor Jeremy Hunt approved the loan guarantee in principle in December. The spokesperson said the company was informed in March that officials were concerned about the fact that the government was underwriting the full value of the loan. A 100% guarantee would be an unusual step that would leave the taxpayer liable for the full amount if the company failed. “Harland & Wolff is aware that the new ministers are in the process of being briefed by civil servants on our case,” the spokesperson said. “We have proposed a reworked deal at the standard 80% guaranteed level, that has been awarded to hundreds of other companies, and look forward to hearing the government’s response. “With the new government having been in office for just over a week, it will take time to work through the process. As yet, we have not been informed of any decision, and we stand ready to meet with the new government at their convenience.” Failure to obtain the guarantee would be a major blow to H&W, which agreed the deal over a year ago with UK Export Finance, a ministerial department. If a government guarantee for the loan is not forthcoming, the company would be forced to ask private lenders for money at standard market rates to refinance its £191m in liabilities. The company’s main priority is refinancing £91m in loans from Riverstone Credit Management, a US private investor that is charging an interest rate of more than 14%. Payment is due at the end of this year. H&W held a board meeting on Tuesday to discuss its finances, according to two sources. However, it has not given workers any updates on the talks, and management of the main shipyard in Belfast has not been briefed, leaving workers unclear over the future of their jobs. “The longer this goes on, the more concern there is,” said a person involved in talks. Labour has taken power with the future of several other UK industrial sites in the balance, including Belfast’s Short Brothers factory, which is being sold by Spirit Aerosystems to Airbus, and the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, where talks between the new government and the owner Tata Steel over decarbonisation and jobs are ongoing.\n",
      "The water regulator is taking action against four more water companies, including Severn Trent and United Utilities, meaning every wastewater company in England and Wales is under investigation over sewage spills.  Ofwat said it had served formal notices on Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities, asking them to provide evidence for its investigation into companies’ wastewater management in England and Wales. The regulator has looked at the companies’ environmental performance and data about how often they spill from storm overflows. It said this had heightened its “concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution”.   Related: Water bills in England and Wales: how much more might you be paying?   This means Ofwat is taking enforcement action against all 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales over sewage pollution. Once it has fully investigated, it will publish its findings and where appropriate take action over any breaches of legal obligations. Along with the Environment Agency, the regulator is investigating water companies over suspicions of widespread illegal sewage discharges across the network from thousands of treatment plants. The investigations have been going on for more than two years, with no findings published so far. In March, analysis of the latest data showed that more than 2,000 overflows owned by a number of companies were discharging raw sewage into rivers and seas. Ofwat’s investigations into Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water are ongoing. Southern Water remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019 over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. David Black, the Ofwat chief executive, said: “The fact that Ofwat now has enforcement cases with all 11 of the wastewater companies in England and Wales demonstrates how concerned we are about the sector’s environmental performance.  “Where we find that companies have breached their obligations, we will continue to act – over recent years, we have imposed penalties and payments of over £300m on water and wastewater companies. “This is the largest and most complex investigation Ofwat has undertaken. However, Ofwat is committed to concluding these cases as quickly as possible, so that the sector can focus on delivering the £88bn expenditure the 2024 price review will unlock to deliver cleaner rivers and seas.  “As part of this package of investment, £10bn is earmarked to tackle storm overflows with a target to reduce spills from storm overflows by 44%.” Severn Trent recently announced a programme to significantly reduce use of storm overflow, which Ofwat welcomed. Shares for Severn Trent and United Utilities, which are listed on the stock market, fell by about 4% and 3%, respectively, after the regulator’s announcement.  Last week, Ofwat was criticised for letting water companies put up bills by an average 21%, or £94, over five years to fund improvements in environmental standards, at a time when customers have endured poor service, sewage dumping and leaks. This was described as a “bitter pill” by the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Campaigners for clean water, including the former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, argue that customers are in effect paying twice, and that they should not be paying for infrastructure investment that should have already been carried out to comply with companies’ operational permits. Severn Trent, United Utilities and Hafren Dyfrdwy said they would work “constructively” with Ofwat. A spokesperson for Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water issued a similar statement, saying: “We have been working closely with our regulators on the monitoring of our wastewater treatment works and are investing at record levels to improve service.”\n",
      "Opinion polls conducted since the weekend suggest Donald Trump’s narrow escape from the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania has made his return to the White House more likely. Until now, little attention has been paid to what Trump 2.0 would mean for the US and wider global economy. That will now change. What the world needs is a period of stability after the repeated blows of recent years. Were Trump to avenge his 2020 defeat at Joe Biden’s hands come November, it would mean the opposite. Sure, there are other reasons for being anxious about a second Trump presidency, but anybody wondering what the next big economic shock might be after the pandemic and the war in Ukraine need look no further than the frontrunner to be in charge of the world’s biggest economy in six months’ time. In its latest health check on the global economy on Tuesday, the IMF highlighted the risks of big swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year. It did not mention the US by name but the implication was clear enough. Unaffordable tax cuts could lead to bigger debt problems, push up long-term interest rates and ratchet up protectionism. The IMF said: “Trade tariffs, alongside a scaling up of industrial policies worldwide, can generate damaging cross-border spillovers, as well as trigger retaliation, resulting in a costly race to the bottom.” Trump’s economic strategy is highly protectionist, it is also incoherent and dangerous. It is incoherent because he appears to think the tariffs he intends to impose on goods entering the US from China (and other countries) will pay for cuts in income tax. In reality, tariffs mean higher prices for US consumers, which will hurt those on low and middle incomes the most. The tax cuts will mostly benefit corporations and better-off individuals. It is dangerous in a number of ways. For a start, there is the risk of prompting a full-blown trade war with China. Then there is the threat that higher prices for imports will drive up US inflation, leading to higher interest rates. Tough curbs on immigration are promised, and these will have the effect of reducing labour supply and adding to the upward pressure on wages. Finally, there are likely to be consequences should Trump go ahead with his isolationist diplomatic policy: more expensive commodities and more jittery financial markets. Trump likes a weak dollar, but in the past the dollar has strengthened in times of heightened global instability, something a Trump presidency makes far more likely. The possible consequences of all this are obvious: stagflation; attempts to strong arm the Federal Reserve into cuts in interest rates; an even bigger crisis for the heavily indebted poor countries that have borrowed in dollars; the further retreat of globalisation. And that’s not even taking into account the risk that the cold war with China could turn hot. Pressure was already mounting on Biden to withdraw from the race before the Pennsylvania shooting and he was already facing a tougher struggle than looked likely six months ago. Then the US was booming, but it is now slowing down and unemployment is on the rise. That’s never a good sign for incumbents in the Oval Office. That said, the US has been by far the best performing economy in the G7 since the end of the Covid pandemic. Inflation rose – as it did across the developed world – in 2021 and 2022, but not to the levels seen in Europe. Biden has delivered on infrastructure and provided a boost to manufacturing, and the subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act represent a more interventionist industrial strategy designed to stimulate green growth. He has delivered for working Americans. However, Biden has the same problem that Rishi Sunak had during the UK general election: voters feel poorer even though they are better off. In the half-dozen or so swing states that will decide who wins in November Trump is ahead. These are not insurmountable leads and in normal circumstances a sitting president would still be reasonably confident of victory at this stage of the campaign. These, though, are not normal times. Trump has been successful in convincing large numbers of voters that the US is doing worse than it actually is. Indeed, he spotted the potential to tap into the discontent of hollowed-out middle America long before his political opponents did. That sense of decline lives on, especially among Republicans. Americans are far more positive about the state of their own finances than they are about the economy in general. The fact that growth is now slowing under the weight of higher interest rates makes it far harder for Biden to counter Trump’s narrative that things have taken a turn for the worse since he was defeated in 2020. The Fed now appears to be gearing up to cut interest rates in September but by then it may be too little, too late for Biden. The state of the economy is no longer Biden’s biggest problem. Sure, the latest unemployment figures showed the US jobless rate rising from 4% to 4.1% in June but by historical standards that is still low. What concerns voters is whether Biden is fit to be president right now, let alone for another four years, and the indications are that he is not. Mistaking Volodymyr Zelenskiy for Vladimir Putin at last week’s Nato summit was merely the latest damaging gaffe. Trump is not exactly a model of cogency either but that’s not the point. He appears to many Americans to be more capable than Biden, particularly after last month’s disastrous head-to-head debate. It boils down to this: would an alternative Democrat candidate be able to flip the campaign so that it focuses on the economic successes of the past four years rather than Biden’s frailty? Would it mean more attention was paid to Trump’s character and his policies? Would it give the Democrats a better chance of winning? The answers to those three questions are yes, yes and yes.\n",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a full investigation into Microsoft’s deal with AI startup Inflection. Earlier this year, Mustafa Suleyman – who started Inflection in January 2022, two months after leaving Google – and a number of his colleagues were hired by Microsoft to lead the tech company’s new AI division. At the same time, Microsoft signed deals with Inflection to access its AI models. The arrangement was criticised by regulators at the time as it avoided the regulatory attention of an outright acquisition. In April, the UK regulator said it was “considering whether it is or may be the case that the transaction has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger”, and opened a three-month comment period. It now has enough evidence to begin a full investigation, it said, with a decision on whether to progress to the next stage due by 11 September. A Microsoft spokesperson said: “We are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger. We will provide the UK Competition and Markets Authority with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.” An Inflection spokesperson said: “Inflection AI is moving rapidly to implement our new enterprise product and strategy while continuing to support our core technology platform. While we don’t want ongoing regulatory inquiries to become a distraction to our commercial focus, we are happy to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation of Microsoft.”   Related: TechScape: Want to know how AI will affect government and politics? The bots have the answers   At the time of the Microsoft and Inflection AI tie-up, the EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said: “We have registered that this is happening and also registering that it’s happening in a way so that it escapes our scrutiny from our usual boxes.” The CMA’s move comes amid broader concerns about competition in the AI sector. Another deal involving Microsoft and French AI startup Mistral was investigated by the CMA at the same time as the Inflection inquiry, though the regulator later dropped its investigation. A deal between Amazon and AI lab Anthropic is also being investigated by the CMA as a potential merger. Anthropic has committed to using Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider, while Amazon has taken a $4bn (£3.1bn) stake in the company, which develops the Claude LLM (large language model). Meanwhile, ChatGPT maker OpenAI took a substantial investment from Microsoft in 2019. This was paid in part in credits for its cloud computing service. Last week, Microsoft dropped its “observer” seat on the board of OpenAI. Instead, Microsoft and Apple, which had been about to take up a similar role, will attend “regular stakeholder meetings”, an OpenAI spokesperson said. The CMA is also investigating the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, after the former took a substantial stake in the latter’s for-profit arm. OpenAI once described the stake as making Microsoft the “minority owner” but this was quietly updated to note the company simply had a “minority economic interest”.\n",
      "The chief executive of Southern Water has received a £183,000 bonus despite submitting a business plan that has been criticised by the industry regulator and attempting to raise bills more than any other English water company. Lawrence Gosden received the bonus as part of a £764,000 pay package, up from £428,000 a year earlier, according to the company’s annual report. Southern Water, which serves 2.5 million customers across south-east England, had proposed to raise water bills by 73% to £727 under its five-year business plan to 2030.   Related: Every water firm in England and Wales under investigation over sewage spills   Last week, the regulator, Ofwat, said the plan “fell short” of minimum expectations and categorised it as “inadequate”. However, it still provisionally allowed a bill increase from £420 to £603, the biggest rise in the country as the company tries to raise funds to fix leaky infrastructure. Including inflation, the increase is even higher – from £451 to £722. Gosden was appointed during the pandemic, in May 2020, to turn around struggling Southern, replacing Ian McAulay who had told MPs he would swim in the rivers and sea amid criticism over sewage dumping. Gosden has worked in the water industry for more than three decades. The report showed the finance chief, Stuart Ledger, received £610,000 – including a £128,000 bonus – up from the £170,000 package he received the previous year, when he joined shortly before the end of the financial year. Ofwat is belatedly attempting to crack down on bonuses paid out in the water industry, as suppliers face anger from the public and MPs over the release of raw sewage into waterways, company debt levels, the dividends paid out, and executive pay. The chief executive of struggling Thames Water, Chris Weston, this month defended his bonus of £195,000 for his first three months in charge. In response to Gosden’s bonus, first reported by the Financial Times, the former Undertones singer turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey posted on X: “See this is how it works. Publish an ‘inadequate’ business plan, persuade the regulator to allow you to increase customers’ bills by 60% over the next 5 years and you get a £764,000 salary including a £183,000 bonus. ‘Trebles all round.’” Southern Water said Gosden and Ledger had hit targets for improving water quality, reducing pollution and cutting customer complaints. However, they missed goals for leakage, sewer flooding, customer experience and cash management. “This bonus will not be paid for from customers’ bills and will be borne by shareholders,” the company said. Southern, which supplies water to customers across a large stretch of south-east England from Hampshire to Kent, as well as the Isle of Wight, said Gosden and Ledger declined to take a bonus for the year before.  Interactive  Southern remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019. On Tuesday, Ofwat broadened its investigation into wastewater management across the industry. In 2021, Southern received a £1bn cash injection to save it from possible renationalisation. It is majority owned by the Australian investor Macquarie, which has been criticised for its stewardship of Thames Water. Last weekend, a £1.2bn scheme for Southern to recycle effluent from the sewage system in Hampshire and turn it into drinking water was called costly and a threat to the environment. A spokesperson for Southern Water said: “Having declined a bonus last year, Southern Water’s chief executive and chief financial officer will receive a partial bonus in 2024, paid by shareholders rather than from customer’s bills, after the board’s remuneration committee acknowledged progress made in delivering on the company’s ambitious turnaround plan. “Despite the region’s wettest year on record, the committee highlighted significant advances in treated water quality, a reduction in overall pollution numbers, and falling customer complaints, but also recognised areas where further progress is needed.”\n",

While the Washington-based IMF nudged up its 2024 growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone, it identified the stickiness of price growth in the service sector as a potential headache for central banks. The IMF did not single out the UK by name but its blanket warning chimes with comments from Bank of England policymakers about the risks of service sector inflation becoming embedded.

A rebound in investment banking activity sent Morgan Stanley’s second quarter profits up a whopping 40% to $3.1bn in the three months to 30 June, up from $2.2bn a year earlier. It follows a boost in fees from investment banking activity, including M&A, debt sales and stock offerings, following a two-year downturn for the wider industry caused by high borrowing costs and economic uncertainty.  Revenue at Morgan Stanley’s investment banking division jumped 51% in the quarter to $1.6bn.  But it was a much different results from Bank of America, which was hit by a drop in net interest income, as well as the amount of money it had to put aside for potential defaults.  Net interest income (NII), which accounts for the difference between what is paid out for deposits versus what is earned from loans, fell 3% to $13.7bn in the quarter, while provisions for bad debts rose to $1.5bn from $1.1bn a year earlier.

Tesla said it had made approximately 387,000 deliveries to customers in the first quarter of 2024, missing market expectations by about 13%. It was its first fall in deliveries in nearly four years.

Updated at 11.34am BST    10.28am BST   Ocado CEO Tim Steiner held a media call this morning, after upgrading guidance at its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world. While technology revenues climbed by almost 22% in the six months to 2 June, there have been concerns that clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, were pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses.Steiner explained that clients had based their rollout plans on trends seen during the Covid pandemic, when online shopping surged, but then fell back as shops reopened.  He brushed off investor concerns, saying “we expect to see a lot of long-term growth,” and added that the global shift to online shopping had resumed. Steiner also said consumer sentiment was also improving, amid further easing of price inflation:  It’s definitely improved. Consumers are in a better position than they were this time about a year ago, when it felt like everything was constantly moving up at crazy levels, other than people’s incomes.  Grocery inflation is running at 1.6% now, below average wage rises. “Obviously consumers are still feeling the pinch”, Steiner added. Commenting on whether Ocado would keep its stock market listing in the UK, he said:   The London market can be tough for some companies.  Obviously, we’ve got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it’s a natural place for that business to be listed.  In the long term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we’re actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well… And those efforts are really where we’re focusing our time and not on where we’re listed.  Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado’s fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas.  He said: “I do think that there is demand for ultra fast services.”     10.01am BST   Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has told the BBC he is committed to the Royal Mail’s obligation to deliver letters across the UK six days a week, if he succeeds in his £3.6bn takeover of the business.  That differs from what has been put in writing, with Kretinsky having previously committed to honouring the so-called Universal Service Obligation, but only for five years. Theoretically, that could mean the prospective new owner could walk away after that period.  But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Kretinsky said:   As long as I’m alive, I completely exclude this, and I’m sure that anybody that would be my successor would absolutely understand this. I say this as an absolutely clear, unconditional commitment: Royal Mail is going to be the provider of Universal Service Obligation in the UK, I would say forever, as long as the service is going to be needed, and as long as we are going to be around.  Kretinsky explained that the five-year written commitment was “the longest commitment that has ever been offered in a situation like this”. Shareholders are expected to greenlight the deal in a vote held on 25 September.  Though the government also has a say over whether it goes ahead, meaning Kretinsky’s written and verbal obligations are likely to come under further scrutiny.      9.34am BST   US retail sales due out this afternoon could bolster hopes for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.  Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank says:   Retail sales in the US are expected to have fallen 0.2% in June.  Such weakness would back the Fed’s easing inflation story and further reinforce the expectation of a September Fed cut.   That is likely to add fuel to Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments that inflation need not fall to 2% before cutting rates.      9.14am BST  Ocado shares jump 18% after upped guidance, Kantar data  Some good news for Ocado that sent its shares surging 18% this morning. The online-only retailer upgraded its annual guidance, saying its key tech solutions division would achieve “mid-teens” EBITDA margins in the current financial year. That is up from previous guidance of over 10%. Kantar data also showed Ocado remained the fastest growing grocer for the fifth month running, with sales up 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July. It now has a hold on 1.8% of the market, up 0.1 percentage points compared with the same period last year. That was faster than discounter Lidle, which saw a 7.8% jump in sales, taking its market share to 8.1%. Ocado shares jumped as much as 18% at the start of trading, and are now up a slightly less exuberant (but still impressive) 11%. That’s good news for a stock that had lost about 55% of its value so far this year.  Updated at 11.26am BST    8.40am BST   The water regulator for England and Wales is taking action against four more water companies including Severn Trent and United Utilities over sewage spills, just days after being accused of showing “contempt” to customers over the latest water bill price rises. Ofwat said it had served formal notices on Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Severn Trent and United Utilities asking them to provide evidence for its investigation into companies’ wastewater management in England and Wales. The regulator has looked at the firms’ environmental performance and data about how often they spill from storm overflows. It said this had heightened its “concerns that these companies may not be fulfilling their obligations to protect the environment and minimise pollution”. This means Ofwat is now taking enforcement action against all 11 water and wastewater companies in England and Wales over sewage pollution. Once it has fully investigated, it will publish its findings and where appropriate take action over any breaches of legal obligations. Investigations into Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South West Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water began two years ago and are ongoing. Southern Water remains subject to enforcement monitoring after a record £126m fine in 2019 over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England.

Food inflation fell 1.6% in the four weeks to July 7, down from 2.1%, with toilet tissues, dog food and butter accounting for the largest fall in prices over the period.  However, prices have continued to rise for items including vitamins, supplements, fruit juices and deodorants. But overall, falling price inflation helped fuel sales of branded products by 3.6%, outpacing grocery stores’ own-label products, which grew at 2.7%.  Easing price growth also coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far in 2024.  People made 2% more trips to the supermarket over the four-week period than they did a year earlier, Kantar said.  And, of course, the men’s Euros football tournament helped fuel purchases of beers crisps and snacks on match days though low alcohol beer sales soared on weekdays as Britons celebrated in relative moderation.  Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said:  England’s hopes might have been dashed on Sunday, but there was still some cause for celebration in the grocery industry.  Football fans drove beer sales up by an average of 13% on the days that the England men’s team played, compared with the same day during the previous week.  Sales of crisps and snacks also got a boost, up by 5% compared with the month before. With many matches played on “school nights”, though, some Britons chose moderation. Spending on no and low-alcohol beer soared by 38% on matchdays.      8.10am BST   European markets are open for trading and major indexes are all in the red this morning:  EUROPE’S STOXX 600 DOWN 0.5% GERMANY’S DAX DOWN 0.6% BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 DOWN 0.4% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 0.6% SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 0.7% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.6%, EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.6%   Updated at 8.10am BST    8.01am BST  Introduction: Fed chair Powell hints rates may be cut before US inflation target hit  Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. The long wait for US interest rate cuts could soon be over.  Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has dropped hints that the central bank will not need to see inflation hit its 2% target before cutting interest rates.  Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington DC, Powell said:   The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%.  Instead, he explained that policymakers are looking for “greater confidence” that price inflation is striding towards that figure:   What increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that.  Traders are currently betting on at least two rate cuts before the end of 2024, starting in September. That could result in a drop in the main federal funds rate, from its current range of 5.25% to 5.50%.  Fed policy makers are next set to meet on July 30-31, though they are expected to hold interest rates steady.

      "The UK faces the prospect of interest rates being higher for longer unless there is more progress in reducing service sector inflation, the International Monetary Fund has warned. While the Washington-based IMF nudged up its 2024 growth forecasts for the UK, it identified the stickiness of price growth in the service sector as a potential headache for the Bank of England. The IMF’s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said the UK was similar to the US in having “somewhat persistent services inflation”. His comments chime with comments from Bank of England policymakers about the risks of service sector inflation becoming embedded.   Related: Of the economy’s two possible endings the happy one is more likely | Larry Elliott   Since the start of the year the headline rate of UK inflation has halved to 2% while service sector inflation has fallen from 6.5% to 5.7%. The Office for National Statistics will release the latest cost of living figures on Wednesday. The IMF said its forecasts for the global economy had not changed much since the release of its world economic outlook (WEO) in April. Its July WEO update left 2024 growth unchanged at 3.2%, while its estimate for 2025 was revised up from 3.2% to 3.3%. A stronger than expected start to 2024 has resulted in the IMF raising its growth estimate for the UK from 0.5% to 0.7%, while the eurozone was upgraded from 0.8% to 0.9%. The fund believes UK growth will continue to pick up and has pencilled in expansion of 1.5% in 2025. Elsewhere, the IMF said the growth gap between the US and the EU would narrow over the next 18 months. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “While it’s welcome that the IMF is forecasting growth to pick up this time, I am under no illusion to the scale of the challenge facing the economy and the inheritance this new government faces. That is why we are already taking the tough decisions to fix the foundations of our economy, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.” While the IMF believes the global economy is on course for a slowdown but not a recession it said the service sector cost pressures were holding up progress in the fight to bring inflation down sustainably. “As in April, we project global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year from 6.7% last year, broadly on track for a soft landing,” Gourinchas said. “But in some advanced economies, especially the US, progress on disinflation has slowed, and risks are to the upside.” Risks of persistent inflation in the services sector were tied to wage and price setting, given that labour accounted for a high share of the costs in that sector. The service sector accounts for about 80% of the UK economy’s output. “Persistently elevated uncertainty around the inflation outlook has led central banks in major advanced economies to become somewhat more cautious about the pace of policy easing, compared with their positions at the end of the first quarter,” the IMF said. The IMF also expressed concern about the potential for significant swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year, with knock-on effects to the rest of the world. Without singling out any country, Gourinchas said he was worried about mounting protectionism. “The gradual dismantling of our multilateral trading system is another key concern. More countries are now going their own way, imposing unilateral tariffs or industrial policy measures whose compliance with World Trade Organization rules is questionable at best,” Gourinchas said. “Our imperfect trading system could be improved, but this surge in unilateral measures isn’t likely to deliver lasting and shared global prosperity. If anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards, and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition.”\n",
      "Shortly before Christmas 1997, Tracy Blackwell found herself in New York with nothing but two suitcases and the sinking feeling that she would have to make another fresh start. At 30, she had just moved there from London with her employer, Goldman Sachs. And while she safely made it stateside, a transatlantic cargo ship had capsized off the Azores, taking all her worldly possessions with it. “You can look back and laugh, but at the time … you don’t know where to start,” Blackwell says. But the US native was more than up to starting from scratch. Back in the UK since the early years of this century, she has risen to chief executive of the London-based Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC), a City firm that helps companies offload the risks of their final salary pension schemes. Since its founding in 2006, PIC has become a market leader in defined benefit pension buyouts, managing the retirement schemes of more than 339,900 policyholders employed by companies including M&S, De Beers and Cadbury. As a major investor with, managing assets of £46.8bn, PIC – and Blackwell, who sits on Labour’s British infrastructure council – has the ear of the new government, as chancellor Rachel Reeves seeks to attract cash for her national wealth fund (NWF), launched last week. This is a kind of power Blackwell never expected to hold. Born in the US rustbelt to a single mother aged just 18, she did not have an easy start. But Blackwell did not intend to stay in Rockford, Illinois, long. “I was in the catchment area for the best high school and I was one of the poorest ones there,” Blackwell says. “I realised that I wanted to do something and I wasn’t going to succeed living in Rockford.” So with money saved from an after-school job scooping ice-cream at Baskin-Robbins, she jumped on a plane to tour Europe. It was a transformative experience for the 17-year-old, whose only previous travel experience was a trip to Hawaii won in a breakfast cereal competition five years earlier. In 1985, as a way of keeping her options open, she enrolled in the University of Illinois’s Gies College of Business. But while working 80-hour weeks – including a stint as a magician’s assistant – to fund her studies, Blackwell was inspired by a finance professor to pursue an interest in financial markets. “I love markets, because it’s everything. It’s how an individual business is running, it’s geopolitics, it’s national politics, it’s the news … It’s the living embodiment of what’s going on in the world. And that’s what I found fascinating.” After doing an MBA, she clinched an interview with Goldman Sachs in London. Passed over for a role in investment banking (she was later told she did not have the right “pedigree”), Blackwell was offered a job in the burgeoning derivatives industry, trading futures contracts, options and swaps, which had been invented just a year earlier. Blackwell, 56, gets a glint in her eye when she talks about those early years at Goldman, where she eventually moved into asset management. But then came the bank’s IPO in 1999. “The whole culture changed. It became much more ruthless, and less like a family,” Blackwell says. She left the City altogether and moved to Norfolk with her husband as she considered her next move. In 2004, she was lured back to finance by former Goldman colleague Danny Truell, who had since become chief investment officer at the Wellcome Trust. Danny and his brother, Eddie, had watched the UK’s 2004 pension reforms with interest. Companies suddenly had to make ironclad guarantees to pay final salary pensions, having previously only paid out if financial conditions allowed. With pension schemes turning into hard liabilities on balance sheets, and requiring more funding every year, companies started closing and offloading those schemes to professional investors that could fund and manage them properly. The Truells saw an opportunity. They pitched the idea to Goldman, which turned them down only to start its own rival, Rothesay, a year later. Blackwell’s interest was piqued and she joined what would become PIC, which made money through surplus returns on long-term investments, including in infrastructure such as universities, renewable energy and social housing.   It is imperative we get growth going. There is no question the planning system is holding it up  Tracy Blackwell    After the 2007-08 financial crisis, PIC started striking pension deals, first with an engineering firm called Swan Hill. Other notable buyouts included a £660m deal with Cadbury and a £1.2bn deal with EMI, for which Blackwell’s team went head to head with Goldman. Blackwell has worked her way to the top of PIC, which now manages assets worth nearly £50bn. She has about £12bn invested in UK infrastructure, a figure both she and the Labour party would like to see grow. Newly installed ministers are hoping to jump-start investment, by getting rid of red tape through planning reforms and by spreading the risk though Reeves’s NWF, which aims to raise £3 in private cash for every £1 of state money put into projects including ports, gigafactories, hydrogen and steel. “If it works, brilliant,” Blackwell says. “It is imperative we get growth going. There is no question the planning system is holding it up.” There are wider bureaucratic problems, too, she says, particularly the way projects need approval from a wide array of arm’s-length public bodies. Her solution is to ensure that all such bodies have a “growth mantra”, and to offer businesses an easy way to bring frustrating delays to central government’s notice. “There’s a lot of really good ideas out there,” Blackwell says. “Some of this stuff just needs to be brought to the government’s attention faster, and they need to do something about it faster. If you’re an investor, you’re not gonna wait for three years to do anything. You’re gonna go somewhere else, because we can invest globally.” CV Age 56Family Married with one son.Education Studied business at Illinois Urbana-Champaign University.

      "Shares in Ocado jumped by as much as 18% after the UK online grocer reported narrowing losses and raised its annual guidance for its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world. Technology revenues climbed by nearly 22% year on year in the six months to 2 June, while retail revenues were also up by 11%. Ocado sells groceries in the UK through its joint venture with Marks & Spencer and was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row based on recent sales figures, according to the data analytics company Kantar. Ocado now expects its tech division to achieve a “mid-teens” Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin this year, up from previous guidance of more than 10%. The company’s overall pre-tax loss in the first half of the year narrowed to £154m, from £290m a year earlier. This reassured investors, and drove Ocado shares sharply higher. The stock closed up 8% at 368.1p but hit 409.1p earlier in the day. The share price has lost 47% this year amid concerns that some clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, are pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses.

Obviously, we’ve got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it’s a natural place for that business to be listed. “In the long-term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we’re actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well … And those efforts are really where we’re focusing our time and not on where we’re listed.” Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado’s fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas.

      "Falling inflation, football fans and fake tan drove supermarket shopping in recent weeks, when improving consumer confidence and excitement around the men’s Euros tournament were only slightly dampened by wet weather. Sales at supermarkets increased by 2.2% year on year over the four weeks to 7 July, with football fans driving up purchases of beers, crisps and snacks on match days. Grocery price inflation has fallen to 1.6% this month from June’s 2.1%, marking the lowest level since September 2021, according to retail analysts Kantar. That drop coincided with the fastest rise in monthly footfall so far this year, with Britons making 2% more trips to the supermarket than a year earlier.

The soggy summer weather boosted sales of artificial tan by 16%, while cold and flu medicine sales jumped by 35%, and dampened demand for sun cream, with sales down 10% compared with last year, when the UK enjoyed the warmest June on record. During the cost of living crisis consumers have switched to supermarkets’ cheaper own-label items but this trend has now reversed, with sales of branded products rising by 3.6%, outpacing own-label groceries at 2.7%. Before the king’s speech on Wednesday, which will set out the newly elected government’s legislative agenda for grocers and other sectors, McKevitt said: “The retail landscape looks very different from 2010 when the last Labour government was in power – and so do our shopping trolleys. “As diets have evolved, sales of popcorn, peanut butter and chilled vegetarian products, such as sausages and grills, have more than trebled. We’re also more likely to have premium ground and bean coffee in our cups now.” Ocado was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row, with sales up by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 7 July giving it a 1.8% market share. The discounter Lidl posted a 7.8% jump in sales, bringing its share of the market to 8.1%, while fellow budget retailer Aldi’s market share is 10%. Waitrose gained market share for the first time since January 2022, edging 0.1 percentage point higher to 4.5%, as spending at the upmarket grocer increased by 3.3%.

      "Britain is taking its first steps towards forging closer trading links with the EU in meetings between the new business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and international counterparts in Italy.  In his first overseas visit since Labour’s election landslide, Reynolds will tell a G7 meeting of trade ministers in the Italian city of Reggio Calabria that the new UK government wants to foster a “closer, more mature relationship with our friends in the EU”. Aiming to reset relations after a volatile period under successive Conservative administrations since the 2016 Brexit vote, he is expected to tell international ministers that Britain is “back on the world stage and ‘open for business’”. Reynolds will add: “We are seeking a closer, more mature, more level-headed relationship with our friends in the European Union – our nearest and largest trading partner, and we also intend to forge better trading relationships with countries around the world.” The meetings come as Keir Starmer tries to build closer links with Brussels by hosting EU leaders at Blenheim Palace near Oxford on Thursday, as part of a one-day European Political Community summit. The prime minister is attempting to walk a tightrope between strengthening EU relations while also telling voters that his government will not take Britain back into the single market or customs union. Starmer is instead relying on more modest reforms and a warmer tone with Brussels. The prime minister insisted during the election campaign that the UK would not rejoin the EU within his lifetime. Instead, Labour committed in its manifesto to building stronger trade and investment links with the 27-nation bloc, including through a veterinary agreement, support for touring artists, and mutual recognition deals for professional qualifications. The EU accounted for 41% of UK exports of goods and services and 52% of imports in 2023. Business leaders have urged Starmer to forge closer links with Brussels given the importance of the EU market to UK companies, while also calling for looser migration rules to give them more access to EU workers. Under the terms of the Brexit deal finalised by Boris Johnson’s government in late December 2020, and in force since January 2021, the UK and the EU are committed to reviewing the implementation of the agreement every five years, with Starmer expected to oversee the first such process in 2026.   Related: Keir Starmer urged to quickly fix ‘broken’ EU settlement scheme   Some commentators have suggested the review could pose an opportunity for the deal to be renegotiated. However, EU officials have argued the process may only offer limited scope for change. Reynolds is expected on Tuesday to hold his first in-person meetings with G7 counterparts since his appointment earlier this month, including with the vice-president of the EU Commission Valdis Dombrovskis and the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck. The new government is hoping a “reset” of international relations will bolster Britain’s status among global businesses and investors, as part of efforts to secure the highest sustained rate of economic growth in the G7. It also comes amid rising geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty elsewhere. The US president, Joe Biden, appeared last week to back Starmer’s ambitions for closer EU ties, telling the prime minister in talks at the White House that this would also strengthen the transatlantic alliance with Washington.\n",
      "The millionaire Labour donor Dale Vince’s £100,000 libel case against the Daily Mail has been thrown out after a high court judge ruled it did not have a realistic chance of success. The green energy businessman and Forest Green Rovers chairman claimed the newspaper libelled him in a June 2023 article titled “Labour repays £100,000 to ‘sex harassment’ donor”. The Daily Mail article was about an entirely separate Labour donor called Davide Serra, who was said to be “a high-flying City financier accused of sex harassment”. The article included a photograph of Vince in his capacity as another high-profile Labour donor who had been the subject of press attention after attending a Just Stop Oil protest in Westminster. Vince’s lawyers, according to the judgment, accepted that anyone who read the entire article “would appreciate very quickly that he was not the person being accused of sexual harassment”. However, they claimed the Daily Mail had defamed Vince by innuendo, by putting a picture of him under a headline about a Labour donor being accused of sex harassment. They said an ordinary reader would assume a headline and picture contained accurate information and “they did not need to read any further than to understand what the article was saying”. Associated Newspapers, the Daily Mail’s parent company, said the case was without merit as case law in England and Wales did not allow a headline and picture to be considered in isolation from the rest of the text. The company said a hypothetical reader, in the eyes of the law, would have read the whole piece and “readers who read only part of an article are not reasonable readers”. They successfully cited a precedent set in a 1995 legal case involving the News of the World and the actors who played Harold and Madge Bishop in the television soap Neighbours. The tabloid had published an article under the headline “Strewth! What’s Harold up to with our Madge?” accompanied by a photograph seemingly showing the two actors having sex. The text of the article later made it clear that the photographs had been produced by the makers of a “sordid” pornographic video game by superimposing the faces on to graphic images. The lords who ruled on the case described the News of the World article as “gutter journalism” that had caused great offence. However, they concluded that for the purposes of libel law, it must be assumed that an ordinary person would read beyond the headline and take in all the nuances of an article. Judge Jaron Lewis concluded that this principle applied to Vince’s case against the Daily Mail, meaning the headline and picture could not be considered in isolation from the rest of the article. As a result, he concluded that Vince’s case was “bound to fail” and could not proceed to trial. Vince said he would seek to appeal against the judge’s decision in an attempt to overturn the legal precedent, arguing that it did not reflect the reality of how people consume the news. He said: “A substantial number of people only read headlines and would have thus been given an entirely false impression. As it stands the Daily Mail can get away with this kind of personal smear – I’m trying to change that.” Vince, who gave millions to Labour in the run-up to the general election, is also suing the rightwing Guido Fawkes blog, the Reform UK MP Richard Tice and the former Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey over comments they made about Vince’s views on Hamas. Paul Staines, the editor of Guido Fawkes, has always hosted his blog offshore to minimise legal threats. He has now said he will give up these protections and fight the case. • This article was amended on 18 July 2024 because an earlier version referred, in one instance, to the Daily Mail headline as being “about a Labour donor being accused of sexual harassment”. To clarify: the reference in the Daily Mail’s headline was to sex harassment.\n",
      "Goldman Sachs has increased banker pay including bonuses by 17% after profits more than doubled in the second quarter, following a rebound in dealmaking. The Wall Street firm said it spent $4.2bn (£3.2bn) on compensation and benefits for its 45,300 staff in the three months to June, up almost a fifth from the same period last year. That figure accounts for salaries and pensions, as well as the amount being put aside for individual bonuses that are distributed at the end of the financial year. Overall, Goldman has spent $8.8bn on compensation and benefits for staff since January, which the bank said reflected “improved operating performance”. Financial filings show that Goldman’s profits surged 150% to $3bn in the second quarter, up from $1.2bn last year. Profits were boosted by a jump in business deals, with its investment bankers helping guide firms through a fresh wave of mergers and takeovers. That includes ExxonMobil’s $60bn takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources in May, for which Goldman acted as a broker alongside the rival banks Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Goldman’s chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, said: “We are pleased with our solid second-quarter results and our overall performance in the first half of the year, reflecting strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset and wealth management.” Investment bankers are emerging from a two-year slump in dealmaking, which was affected by high borrowing rates and economic uncertainty. A brighter economic outlook, as well as expectations that the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, has boosted demand for services from banks such as Goldman Sachs. That is likely to translate into larger bonuses, including for Goldman’s 6,000 UK staff, who will no longer be bound by a banker bonus cap that previously limited bonuses to twice the individual’s salary. The UK bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. Prior to Labour’s general election victory, the incoming chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the party had no plans to reinstate the banker bonus cap. Richard Gnodde, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, announced in May that the bank would be changing its pay structure, giving hundreds of its highest-earning staff the ability to make 25 times their salaries in bonuses.\n",
      "Burberry has blessings that other brands would kill for. Everyone knows what a Burberry trenchcoat is, and pretty much everyone would be thrilled to have one. Burberry is a household name at a time when shoppers buying luxuries prize a prestige brand more than anything else. It is one of the elite labels that have meaning in the world of power and status, not only fashion. In the trenchcoat – a perennial wardrobe classic – it owns prized real estate on the Monopoly board of luxury. (Consider how much mileage Gucci makes out of owning the loafer.) It has 168 years of heritage, and a bone-deep authenticity as the outfitter of Scott and Shackleton. It makes coats that last a lifetime, which chimes with modern values of sustainability. It stands for Britishness and quality. Success should, surely, be an open goal. Fashion is seldom that simple, however, and Burberry’s advantages are also its problems. It is a coat brand in a world where bags and shoes, not clothes, are cash cows. It is synonymous with Britishness, leaving it beached and disconnected from the continental powerhouses of Paris and Milan. Burberry’s fashion glory days were under the designer Christopher Bailey, who over the course of almost two decades transformed it from a reliable but dull coat maker into a style powerhouse. Bailey grabbed British cultural references that spoke to a broad audience – the Beatles, Princess Margaret, David Hockney, Marianne Faithfull – to create a look that was aspirational but accessible, classy without being snobbish. By packing his front rows with politicians and rappers, as well as actors and supermodels, he gave Burberry a context in culture. He popped the collar on the trenchcoat, streamlined it into a more flattering silhouette, and built out the colour palette from boring beige into soft neutrals. Bailey’s successors, the Italian designer Riccardo Tisci and, since 2022, the Yorkshire-born Daniel Lee, have attempted to take Burberry in a different direction – cooler, haughtier, edgier. Fickle consumers had grown tired of the cosy Burberry world that Bailey had built, and Tisci, who had enjoyed stellar success as a pioneer of luxury streetwear at Givenchy, believed he could bring the same magic to British shores. But neither Tisci nor Lee have found a way to join the dots between avant garde catwalk looks and what consumers want from Burberry. In recent seasons Burberry has taken the audience deliberately outside their comfort zone, with shows staged in huge tents in London parks with utilitarian stuffed bench seating and dark lighting. The vibe is one part explorers’ base camp, one part festival dance tent. The emphasis is on the shock – rather than the feelgood – factor. Burberry needs to create clothes – and, crucially, bags and shoes – that make fashion fall in love with the brand again. That the shake-up announced on Monday brings in Joshua Schulman – an alumnus of Coach and Michael Kors, the home of friendly-looking, accessible-level designer bags – as chief executive speaks to a change of direction. Lee is a highly talented designer, with an instinct for the zeitgeist that led to him transforming Bottega Veneta from a relatively obscure Milanese house into an Instagram sensation, before he took on Burberry. A trench with soft scallop edging, a rugged parka lined in a deep olive version of the Burberry check, a storm-collared leather jacket, are just three from a lineup of extremely desirable pieces in his most recent show. But in aiming for cool, his Burberry sometimes ends up feeling chilly and sullen. Warm reviews mean nothing if the people aren’t buying it. In fashion, the customer is always right.\n",
      "  3.03pm BST  Shares in Donald Trump's media company rise as Wall Street is buoyed  Shares in Donald Trump’s media company have surged to their highest point since mid-June in the opening minutes of trading on Wall Street, as investors bet that the attempted assassination of the former president will boost his chances of re-election. The share price of Trump Media and Technology Group soared as high as $46.27 on Monday morning in New York – before dropping back to $39. That was a steep 27% increase, although not quite the $50 mark that had been indicated in pre-market trading. The theory that traders appeared to be following was that the assassination attempt makes Trump’s election more likely in November, and that that would somehow increase earnings significantly from Truth Social, his rival network to X, formerly Twitter. But it was not just Trump-specific assets that gained ground. US markets also rose more broadly, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose to a new record high. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, an investment bank, said:  The narrative for the day rests on the “Trump Trade” with many investors assuming the weekend events add to the former president being re-elected. The logic being that the chances of tax cut extensions and higher trade tariffs – leading to even higher US fiscal deficits, even alongside potential growth headwinds and intense political pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease as inflation continues to subside near term. Some also suspect a possible withdrawal of US support for Ukraine would also up fiscal pressures in Europe, who may then have to pick up the funding for the war.

Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters:  S&P 500 UP 23.71 POINTS, OR 0.42%, AT 5,639.06 NASDAQ UP 92.11 POINTS, OR 0.50%, AT 18,490.56 DOW JONES UP 281.17 POINTS, OR 0.70%, AT 40,282.07  The assassination attempt, and Trump’s defiant reaction, have prompted some people to say that a Republican victory is more likely. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said:  In a Republican administration, you’ll see a lower tax policy, lower regulatory policy... that’s typically good for stocks. We’re seeing some of that in terms of forward looking expectations from investors at this point.   Updated at 2.38pm BST    2.17pm BST   What will China do to try to hit its 5% annual growth target, given the slowdown revealed today? Duncan Wrigley, chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said:  President Xi Jinping today delivered a work report at the Third Plenum on deepening reform and promoting modernisation, with details yet to be released. The focus will probably be on promoting high-tech and manufacturing as the path to higher productivity and sustained growth in the longer term. Measures to encourage private-sector and foreign business investment are likely, but sweeping reforms to create a consumption-driven growth model, such as household residency reform or building a universal welfare system, are unlikely.       2.13pm BST   The FTSE 100 is down by 0.3% in London. Burberry apart, some of the biggest fallers are miners, who have been hit by concerns over the Chinese economy. Mining company Antofagasta, whose speciality is copper, fell by 4.1%, while Anglo American fell by 2.1%. China is struggling to keep up the speed of its economy, as the property industry and consumption slow. Lynn Son, chief economist for Greater China at ING, an investment bank, said:  The drag from the property market should come as no surprise. The actual drag on GDP growth will likely persist for an extended period of time, as even if prices bottom out, there is still a high level of inventories that need to be digested before new investment takes place.  And that has hit consumption:  A negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries’ cost cutting, is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic “eat drink and play” theme consumption.  However, there was still demand from industry, which could help the Chinese economy weather the slump in spending:  We continued to see strong growth in hi-tech manufacturing (8.8% YoY) and computer and electronic equipment manufacturing (11.3% YoY), which should remain a major area for growth as China prioritises its transition toward higher end manufacturing and establishing technological self-sufficiency.      1.55pm BST   Pressure on Beijing to take steps to improve Chinese consumer confidence has intensified after news that weak retail spending dragged down the growth rate of the world’s second biggest economy. With falling house prices still acting as a drag on activity, official figures showed the Chinese economy expanding at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter – much weaker than the 5.1% expected by the financial markets. Annual retail sales growth slowed from 3.2% to 2% in the three months ending in June – the weakest in 18 months – and fell slightly in June alone. You can read the full report here:   Related: China’s economic growth slows amid weak retail spending        1.52pm BST   We have had some economic updates on industry in Europe and the US. In Europe, industrial production data published this morning showed that output fell by 0.6% during May – less than the 0.8% expected by economists. Output over the course of the previous year was also revised up slightly, although it was still down by 2.9%. In the US, the New York Federal Reserve’s manufacturing survey showed activity slowing slightly – although it was better than expected.     1.16pm BST  Goldman Sachs doubles profits to $3bn  Goldman Sachs made profits of $3bn in the second quarter of 2024, more than double last year thanks to strong bond trading profits. The Wall Street bank’s revenues were $12.7bn for the second quarter of 2024, 17% higher than the second quarter of 2023, but 10% lower than the bumper first quarter of 2024 when it benefited from a surge in debt issues and some major mergers and acquisitions. Goldman’s share price is up by nearly a quarter so far in 2024, as investors appear to welcome a return to focusing on the investment banking that made it one of the best known names in US finance. Goldman had made a brief foray into consumer banking. The bank’s strong share price performance has benefited its bankers, whose shared bonus pot increased by 20% this year. David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive, said:  We are pleased with our solid second quarter results and our overall performance in the first half of the year, reflecting strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset and wealth management.      12.47pm BST  Bank of England policymaker says interest rates should be cut  The Bank of England needs to “stop squeezing living standards” and cut interest rates, a senior policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), said official borrowing costs should be cut at its next meeting on 1 August to ease pressure on households and businesses. Dhingra told the Rest is Money podcast:  Now is the time to start normalising [interest rates], so that we can then finally stop squeezing living standards the way we have been to try and get inflation down. We are weighing on living standards and that cost does not need to be paid.  Whether the Bank cuts borrowing costs in August for the first time since the Covid pandemic is thought to be on a knife-edge, with City investors pricing in a 50/50 chance of a cut from the current level of 5.25%.

Ocado fell by 11.3% on Monday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index. Only Burberry – now down 17% after dispensing with its chief executive – has done worse today. Ocado uses robots running around grids to try to make supermarket deliveries more efficient and therefore profitable. However, after surging in value during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, investors have grown wary of its expected cash needs. Reuters reports that Bernstein, a US brokerage, has said the company’s shares will “underperform”, compared to a previous rating of “outperform”. It expects the share price to move towards 260p – a stark cut from its previous target of 1000p. The report suggests that Ocado should “consider its options” to go private in a grocery deal and reduce cash burn. That would be a major blow to the London Stock Exchange, given that Ocado is one of the few prominent UK tech companies.  The broker said:  Liquidity challenge is real and significant with both existing debt refinancing and a need for more cash soon.      11.50am BST  UK government's NatWest stake falls below 20%  The UK government’s stake in NatWest has fallen below 20% for the first time since the bank was bailed out during the financial crisis. NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, said that the government now owns 19.97% of its shares, after selling off 81m. The government had owned 38% in May, before a programme of share sales. Paul Thwaite, NatWest’s chief executive, said:  Returning NatWest Group to full private ownership remains a key ambition and we believe it is in the best interests of both the bank and all our shareholders.      11.05am BST  Trump set for paper gain of $2bn as shares in media company surge  Let’s take a closer look at the numbers for Donald Trump’s media company: he could be in line for a paper gain of $2bn thanks to the soaring valuation after the failed assassination attempt over the weekend. Trump Media and Technology Group’s shares started trading at $57.25 on 26 March, when it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (Spac). It soared on its first day to a high of $79.38 – briefly valuing it at more than $10bn. It has not hit those heights since then. Spacs became a sensation during the financial market bubble during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. A shell company lists on the stock market, raises a load of cash, and then looks for a company to merge with – offering a quicker route to a listing. Trump’s company – whose stock market ticker bears his initials, DJT – jumped on the Spac bandwagon, and benefited from the “meme stock” craze as many political supporters bought in. Yet the financial reality facing the company has been quite tricky, as the Truth Social network has struggled to attract the users to justify its lofty valuation. In April the company’s share price dropped as low as $22.55. It has never recovered to its opening price on 26 March, and by Friday it was at $30.89. In pre-market trading (which happens off the main stock exchange) the value of DJT shares rose by as much as 70%, although that surge has weakened somewhat in recent minutes. Google Finance suggests the share price is up 53% at $47.29. DJT was worth $5.87bn at the close on Friday, and Trump himself owns 60%, according to Refinitiv. If that 53% gain is replicated when US markets open, then the notional value of Trump’s fortune would rise by about $2bn. However, Trump is prevented from cashing out on his fortune until September, under terms that prevent him selling shares. The US presidential election does not take place until November.  Updated at 11.06am BST    10.23am BST   The reaction to the Trump assassination attempt on traditional financial markets has been fairly muted – especially compared with the Trump Media & Technology Group share price surge. The US dollar is almost flat against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, while US futures prices suggest US benchmark stock indices will gain about 0.5% when they open later. US Treasury bond yields have tended to rise when the prospect of Donald Trump winning back the presidency appears to increase. That is on the assumption that his economic policies would increase inflation and add to government debt. The price of benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds fell in price on Monday. The yield on those bonds (which moves inversely to prices) rose by 0.02 percentage points to 4.206.     9.46am BST  Share price of Trump's Truth Social company rises 70% pre-market  The share price of Donald Trump’s media company has surged in pre-market trading after the attempted assassination of the US presidential candidate. Demand for shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the owner of the X rival Truth Social, appeared to soar on Monday. The share price rose 70% in trading ahead of the opening of New York’s Nasdaq stock exchange. Traders appear to be speculating that the assassination attempt makes a Trump victory in the November presidential election more likely, and that that would benefit TMTG, despite its financial struggles so far.  Updated at 9.46am BST    9.15am BST  Bitcoin jump linked to Trump assassination attempt by analysts  The price of bitcoin has jumped 10% in a move that some analysts have linked to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday. The price of one bitcoin rose above $63,000 on Monday, and was up 9% over the day, according to Refinitiv. The cryptocurrency – which tends to be more volatile than many traditional assets – had slumped from above $70,000 in early June to below $54,000 in early July. Its record high was in March, when it hit 73,803. The theory is that the Trump’s defiance after the assassination attempt makes him more likely to win, and that he will then be more likely to ease regulations on bitcoin, as he has courted crypto advocates, including in a June meeting with crypto “miners” (owners of computers that make the calculations crucial to the decentralised cryptocurrency’s functioning). Many cryptocurrency advocates have links to libertarian politics.  The price of #Bitcoin is up nearly 10%(!) following the attack on Donald #Trump. As the odds of Trump winning the US elections rise, so does Bitcoin, underscoring that it is highly susceptible to shifts in the political landscape. This makes the work of investors harder, as… pic.twitter.com/Z8HLrEMEVw— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) July 15, 2024  Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com, an online trading platform, said that bitcoin had gained after Joe Biden’s poor performance in a debate against Trump earlier this month:  I believe that US political news is driving gains in cryptocurrencies because it is a “speculation-driven” area. If re-elected, Trump may seek less stringent regulatory policies towards cryptocurrencies, potentially improving regulatory conditions and encouraging more investments. His policies towards international relations and foreign trade also have a significant impact on the market, as tensions or stability in international relations may lead to fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets.

UK revenues for the London-listed company were down 18%, while Asia Pacific revenues were down 15%. Toby Fowlston, chief executive, said:  Fee income for the first half of 2024 continued to reflect the rebasing in market conditions relative to the post-pandemic peak. This period of market adjustment is now longer in duration than previously expected, with macroeconomic turbulence and political uncertainty restraining client and candidate confidence in certain geographies. Our near-term planning now assumes that any material improvement in confidence levels will be gradual, and likely not occur before 2025.      8.38am BST   Burberry’s struggles and the surprisingly weak Chinese economic figures are putting luxury and fashion stocks across Europe under pressure. Watch company Swatch Group also reported a steep fall in sales in the first half of its financial year. JP Morgan analysts said that Swatch has one of the highest exposures to China among its European rivals, according to Reuters. they wrote:  We think the sector will likely come under pressure first thing this morning, and notably Richemont, the most obvious read-across.  Cartier owner Richemont fell 2.6% and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH was down 1.7%.     8.13am BST   As might be expected after such a brutal set of news on Monday morning, Burberry’s share price has slumped. The fashion company is down 11% in early trading. It has been a pretty torrid year. You can see today’s slump in the very bottom right of the below chart, but it has been one-way traffic for much of 2024. Shares are down 45% for the year.     8.06am BST   It looks like those Chinese GDP data may have set the mood for Monday on stock markets, with Europe’s indices falling at the opening bell. London’s FTSE 100 and Spain’s Ibex are both down 0.4% in early trading, so it doesn’t seem to be a reaction to the football at least. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters:  EUROPE’S STOXX 600 DOWN 0.3% GERMANY’S DAX DOWN 0.2% BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 DOWN 0.4% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 0.5%, SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 0.4% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 0.4%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 0.4%      8.00am BST  Burberry replaces boss as loss expected; Chinese retail weakness slows growth  Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. All change at the top of British fashion: Burberry has announced the departure of chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd after it was forced to cancel its dividend after a slump in sales. Akeroyd has left the FTSE 100 company “with immediate effect by mutual agreement with the board”, Burberry said on Monday morning. Burberry has appointed American Joshua Schulman, a former Michael Kors boss, to replace him. Gerry Murphy, Burberry’s chair said the performance was “disappointing”. He said:  We moved quickly with our creative transition in a luxury market that is proving more challenging than expected. The weakness we highlighted coming into full year 2025 has deepened and if the current trend persists through our second quarter, we expect to report an operating loss for our first half. In light of current trading, we have decided to suspend dividend payments in respect of full year 2025.  The data published by Burberry in its accompanying trading update do not make for pretty reading for shareholders: comparable store sales are down by 21% to £458m in the 13 weeks to 29 June.  In the Asia Pacific region sales are down by 23%. Revenues across the entire financial year could drop by 30%. Burberry said:  We are operating against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand with all key regions impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and contributing to the sector slowdown.  Chinese GDP grows by 4.7%, below 5.1% forecast Buberry’s struggles have been put into context by Chinese GDP figures earlier this morning: growth slowed to 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, down from 5.3% in the first quarter and below the 5.1% expected by economists polled by Reuters. China’s Communist party leaders are meeting for their “third plenum” this week, the forum that takes place about every five years at which they set out their long-term policies on the economy. The government is aiming for 5% growth in 2024, which may be a challenging target if the weakness persists. The figures were “hampered mainly by weak consumer spending and demand”, said analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid. They added:  Other data showed that China’s retail sales slowed to +2.0% y/y in June (v/s +3.4% expected and the worst since December 2022) after advancing +3.7% in May, thus highlighting that the world’s second largest economy is struggling to boost consumption. Adding to the negative sentiment, China’s home prices fell again in June, declining -0.67% on the month with existing home prices declining -0.85%.

Related: China posts record trade surplus as foreign importers rush to beat tariffs   Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING bank, said retail sales growth was the lowest since the country emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns and showed the depressed state of consumer confidence remained a big headwind to the economic recovery. “A negative wealth effect from falling property and stock prices, as well as low wage growth amid various industries’ cost cutting is dragging consumption and causing a pivot from big-ticket purchases toward a basic ‘eat, drink and play’ theme,” Song said. The government in Beijing has set a growth target for 2024 of 5% – something analysts consider to be a stretch in the absence of tax cuts, spending increases and measures to help the property market. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.7% in the three months to June, compared with a downwardly revised 1.5% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said. To counter soft domestic demand and its property crisis, China has increased infrastructure investment and ploughed funds into hi-tech manufacturing. Strong export growth has partly compensated for the reluctance of consumers to spend. Figures released last week showed China’s exports in June were up 8.6% from a year earlier, while imports shrank by 2.3%. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China+ economist at Pantheon Macro, said: “The property market is showing tentative signs of bottoming out. New home prices sank 0.67% month on month in June, a trivial improvement from the 0.71% drop in May. Preowned home prices dropped 0.85%, after the 1.00% dive in May. Residential sales value fell 12.2% year on year in June, partly thanks to base effects, after crashing 26.4% in May.” \n",
      "Water companies must be transparent with the public about sewage spill data, the UK’s information commissioner has warned. John Edwards has written to the water companies calling on them to be as transparent as possible with their customers, and has asked them to disclose information related to sewage discharges every month. Water companies have recently been uncooperative with data requests, refusing to reveal memos and data about sewage discharges. The companies operate a monopoly, meaning customers cannot switch to another provider if they are unhappy with the service. One of the few powers the public has is to request data about sewage spills under freedom of information laws. The true scale of sewage spills into English rivers was first revealed under data transparency laws. In 2020, the Guardian reported that water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions in 2019. The figures were obtained via environmental information requests, and traced releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies. Last year, there was a record amount of human waste dumped in waterways. In 2023, raw sewage was discharged for more than 3.6m hours into rivers and seas, in a 105% increase on the previous 12 months. Edwards said: “My message to water companies is simple – put transparency first. The public has no choice but to use our water companies, therefore these companies should ensure they have every confidence in doing so. The current concerns about sewage pollution have dented this confidence, so we’re calling on these companies to be open about their activities to help rebuild this trust. It’s both their responsibility and their legal obligation.” In May 2024, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued six water companies – Anglian Water, Severn Trent Water, South West Water, Northumbrian Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water – with decision notices requiring them to disclose the start and stop time of sewage discharges. David Black, the chief executive of the industry body Ofwat, said: “One of the prerequisites for building public trust is a culture of openness. As trust in the water sector is falling, that tells us companies have more to do. They should move to embrace open data as a matter of course, and they should be more open in sharing their plans and progress. And they should not wait to be pushed. Customers have paid companies to install monitors and collect their data. They have a right to see what it says.” Water companies have previously refused to release information about sewage spills when there are investigations ongoing into the leaks. Recently, a tribunal case found that a legal exception, which says releasing information would prejudice an investigation, did not apply to the requested information.  Edwards said: “In the past, water companies have argued that disclosing information could prejudice ongoing investigations. It is now clear, following this tribunal ruling, that this defence should not stand in the way of transparency – just because information could be relevant to an ongoing investigation does not necessarily mean that it cannot or should not be released.”\n",
      "The Bank of England needs to “stop squeezing living standards” and cut interest rates, a senior policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), said official borrowing costs should be cut at its next meeting on 1 August to ease pressure on households and businesses. “Now is the time to start normalising [interest rates], so that we can then finally stop squeezing living standards the way we have been to try and get inflation down,” Dhingra told the Rest is Money podcast. “We are weighing on living standards and that cost does not need to be paid.”   Related: Shares in Trump’s media company surge and bitcoin rises after assassination attempt – business live   Whether the Bank cuts borrowing costs in August for the first time since the Covid pandemic is thought to be on a knife-edge, with City investors pricing in a 50/50 chance of a cut from the current level of 5.25%. Households’ hopes for a cut received a setback last week when the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, warned that key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”. Jonathan Haskell, another member of the MPC, said last week that he favoured keeping rates unchanged. The most dovish member of the MPC, Dhingra has been a consistent advocate of cutting interest rates since first casting a vote to reduce official borrowing costs in February. She said inflation had fallen sharply and was on track to moderate further in the coming months. The consumer prices index (CPI) eased to 2% in May, down from 2.3% in April, hitting the Bank’s target. Producer prices – the prices charged by manufacturers, which can reflect future changes in consumer prices – have also fallen in recent months, according to official figures. Dhingra said this was a harbinger for consumer prices. “We still think there is more to come in terms of deflationary forces, including if you look at non-energy services which is what people have been concerned about,” she said. Interest rates were raised at 14 successive meetings of the MPC between December 2021 and August 2023, taking them from 0.1% to their current level – driving up the cost of mortgages and loans for households and businesses.\n",
      "Burberry has warned again on profits and ousted its chief executive, as the struggling British luxury fashion brand announced a change of direction to “reconnect” with core customers. In an unscheduled trading update on Monday, Burberry said Jonathan Akeroyd was leaving the company with immediate effect and “by mutual agreement with the board”. It comes less than three years after the former Versace boss was appointed in 2021. Burberry has parachuted in a former chief executive of the US fashion brand Coach, Joshua Schulman, to the top role to replace Akeroyd and revealed a list of “immediate actions” needed to reverse the company’s fortunes after issuing its second profit warning this year.   Related: Burberry ousts chief executive; China economic growth disappoints – business live   It follows a double-digit decline in sales across its core markets in what the company described as a “disappointing” first quarter. Store sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific tumbled 23%, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa dropped 16%. Burberry’s London-listed shares plunged 15% after the gloomy statement on Monday morning, making it the top faller on the FTSE 100. The company also announced it was suspending shareholder dividend payouts. The fashion brand said that under Schulman’s leadership it would focus on “more of the timeless, classic attributes that Burberry is known for”. That will include an outerwear campaign to be launched globally in October, “building on the established resilience of our house icons”. “We believe there is an opportunity to reconnect with our core customer base and capitalise on the enduring appeal of Burberry’s iconic products and brand while delivering relevant newness,” the company said.  The brand’s chair, Gerry Murphy, said that would mean shifting focus back on to products that have historically been key to the brand’s growth, including its trench coats and scarves, known for the distinctive Burberry check pattern.  Burberry has been suffering amid a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, which also hit the sales of rivals including Kering, which owns brands including Gucci and Balenciaga, and Mulberry earlier this year. However, Burberry’s failure to revive sales has clearly caused concern among board members, including Murphy who called the first-quarter results “disappointing”. “We moved quickly with our creative transition in a luxury market that is proving more challenging than expected,” he said. “If the current trend persists through our Q2, we expect to report an operating loss for our first half.” Murphy added: “We expect the actions we are taking, including cost savings, to start to deliver an improvement in our second half and to strengthen our competitive position and underpin long-term growth.” Bosses confirmed on a press call that those actions would result in “a few hundred” job cuts, primarily in its UK corporate office, and that consultations were already under way. It will also mean working to improve online sales with a website revamp next month. Murphy pushed back against claims that Burberry’s strategy now appeared “incoherent”, arguing: “The strategy has been quite coherent for a while.” “With the benefit of hindsight, in a weak market we perhaps went a bit too far, too fast with the creative transition, at a time when customers are feeling a bit more challenged, [and] a bit more conservative,” he told journalists, explaining that shoppers seemed less willing to try new items that came with high price tags. “We’ve recognised that by saying, look: we’ve got to re-establish the prominence of our core offer … products that are timeless classics familiar to Burberry’s customers.” He said the board had not had any “serious discussions” about replacing the chief executive until very recently, and had already been speaking to Schulman, who is also a former director of the British luxury paint company Farrow & Ball, about taking a potential role on its board. As for its outgoing boss, Murphy said Akeroyd was “popular and very well liked, and respected here by everybody, including the board. But sometimes, things don’t work as planned and you have to change your plans, and that’s what we’ve agreed with Jonathan and that’s really all I want to say about it.” \n",
      "Lloyds Banking Group will start converting its disused office sites into social housing, as the UK’s largest mortgage provider lays the groundwork for a fresh housebuilding boom after Labour’s election win. The bank, which started reviewing its property portfolio during the Covid lockdown in 2020, is launching the programme with a decommissioned data and office space in Pudsey, West Yorkshire.  Lloyds will sell the site to a local housing group with the agreement that 80 new homes will then be rented at about half the usual rate. Lloyds said it was assessing other potential offices and datacentres in the UK that it could do something similar with.   Related: Labour cannot build 1.5m homes without cash for affordable housing, providers say   Meanwhile, Lloyds announced it was also expanding its Citra Living private rental arm to become the first UK bank in the affordable housing market. Citra, which was launched in 2021 to diversify income from traditional lending, will buy the homes and remain the landlord, while local authorities take on everyday management. The pilot will start in Cambridge next month, with rentals offered to struggling households at 80% of market rates. It is part of a wider package of measures announced by the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, as he prepares to host housing bosses and policymakers for an inaugural social housing forum in London on Monday, where he will continue calls to build 1m social and affordable homes. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged to build 1.5m new homes to address the UK’s housing crisis over the next five years. While Labour has not yet detailed how many of those homes will be offered social or affordable rates, Nunn said he was cautiously hopeful that the party would achieve more than the Tory party was able to during its 14 years in office. “Labour’s commitment to it is clearer than the last government,” Nunn told the Guardian. “We obviously didn’t see, in the last period of time, some of the changes that would be needed to really unlock the level of the ambition that we think is needed for the UK to prosper going forward.” Sceptics will question why a commercial lender would be willing to sacrifice larger profits, especially at a time when interest rates are expected to drop and eat into bank earnings. One reason is that affordable homes are a reliable source of income. With UK households facing a chronic shortage of new homes and near-record house prices, there will be consistent demand for affordable housing. Affordable rents can make it easier for people to save up a deposit to eventually buy a home. That could indirectly benefit Lloyds, which owns the Halifax brand and is the UK’s largest mortgage lender. “When you’re in the affordable space, [which is] the low end of the private rental space, we think that’s a really important pathway to home ownership,” Nunn said. Citra also launched its first rent-to-buy scheme last year. Nunn insisted there were no plans to package up and securitise the projects, which would involve bundling affordable rental contracts and selling off slices to investors on the open market. However, Lloyds may end up seeking co-investors, particularly insurers and pension providers, that are also on the hunt for reliable returns for savers and retirees. That could also involve deploying retirement savings from Lloyds’ Scottish Widows arm. “All pension plans have 30- or 40-year or 50-year payouts that they’re managing. There is that opportunity to put a percentage of that money into a long-term investment, like housing. So that’s not packaging them up or securitising … that’s actually putting them as a bedrock of a stable source of returns for pensioners,” Nunn said. Lloyds is also ring-fencing £200m worth of loans for small housing providers who would otherwise struggle to access funding. Nunn admitted there was a “low return hurdle”, meaning Lloyds is prepared to make less money on the loans than usual, but he insisted that it was “a return that does meet our shareholders expectations”. Nunn is now hoping his social housing forum, scheduled less than two weeks after the general election, gains the attention of the new Labour government. That could open the door to talks with Nunn’s social housing initiative group, which includes bosses from Homes England, Legal & General, the housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes, the homelessness charity Crisis, as well as local authorities and housing associations. “I’d like to get a chance to engage on the policy agenda because we now have a group of people who have got really specific ideas,” Nunn said.\n",
      "The number of agreed house sales over the past month was 15% up on this time last year, according to Rightmove, as buyers anticipate “gamechanging” interest rate cuts they hope could come as early as August. Britain’s biggest property website said homebuyers largely shrugged off the “distractions” of the general election and the Euro 2024 football tournament to keep transactions well above this time last year. It said the average price of property coming to the market for sale dropped a fractional 0.4%, or £1,617, to £373,493, although it warned prices in the south-east fell by 2% alone.   Related: UK house prices remain subdued for third successive month   However, Rightmove said the number of sales being agreed was now an “encouraging” 15% above the same period a year ago and sales were likely to increase by the autumn. This time last year the UK market was struggling to cope with the peak of mortgage rates. The Rightmove director Tim Bannister said many would-be home movers were waiting for the first Bank of England rate cut, from a current level of 5.25%, before acting. Households’ hopes of a cut in interest rates received mixed messages last week. On Wednesday the chief economist of the Bank of England, Huw Pill, said key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”, somewhat dampening hopes of an early August rate cut. However, a number of big-name lenders appeared to think otherwise, as by the end of last week they had all cut the price of their best mortgage deals. The UK’s biggest lender, Halifax, reduced its rates by up to 0.13%, while Barclays reduced them by up to 0.33%. The bank’s five-year fixed-rate mortgage is now the cheapest on the market at 4.08%. Their moves follow a series of cuts from lenders including NatWest and HSBC over the past few weeks. A rate war appears to be under way, say brokers. Adrian Anderson, the managing director of the brokerage Anderson Harris, said cheaper mortgage rates would have a positive impact on people’s ability and willingness to borrow. He also said he would not be surprised to see some five-year fixed-rate mortgages priced below 4% by the end of the year. Rightmove said that the average five-year fixed rate was now 4.97%, which while substantially below the peak of 6.11% in July 2023, is still much higher than the average of 2.51% that homebuyers were being offered back in July 2021. Rightmove’s Bannister said interest rate cuts could be the gamechanger that would kickstart the market. “A first base rate cut [by the Bank of England] for over four years, together with the new political certainty, could set the scene for a positive autumn market, with improved affordability and a more confident outlook in the second half of the year,” he said.\n",
      "Nils Pratley’s article on the water industry in England and Wales provided a succinct summary of the sector’s history, and how it was brought down by investor greed and weak regulation (Cheap sales, debt and foreign takeovers: how privatisation changed the water industry, 10 July). The privatisation story, however, has two halves. The first was one of increased investment (after years of inadequate public funding), with improved operational and capital efficiency. Purposeful design headed off asset-stripping, while excessively entrepreneurial activities were constrained. The second half saw regulatory relaxation, weakened environmental enforcement, and infrastructure funds seeking better returns. Investors know that high returns can’t be sustainably delivered by low-risk businesses, but it didn’t stop new owners and lenders stepping in, leading to overborrowing. This is the heart of the issue, and a more proactive regulator might have headed this off – given that “whole company securitisation” was part of the private equity playbook by that time. Fortunately, Thames Water has plenty of funding to cover ongoing operating costs – but it may not be able to service its debt.  This must be restructured to an affordable level, and financiers will have to bear the cost of their own greed or incompetence. Thereafter the company will be highly investable. Such a restructuring might best be negotiated without the need for receivership, nationalisation or special administration. Politically savvy financiers might welcome this. Yes, excess dividends may have been taken, but those are now gone – unless the companies acted illegally. However, like the billions lost to Covid misspending, HS2 and other government mistakes, we have to accept them – the difference being that these losses are recovered through highly visible water bills rather than opaquely through our taxes.Bill KingdomOxford • As a former regulator – in water, rail and the ill-fated London Underground public-private partnership (PPP) – I understood that the first rule of regulation should be that customers should only pay once. But this still raises the question of the nature of the “regulatory contract”. In the PPP, it was decided (rightly or wrongly) that the infrastructure companies should be paid the efficient cost of delivering outputs, even if these costs were initially underestimated. For most regulated industries, including water, the contract is essentially a fixed-price one, subject to adjustment only for specified items such as changes in legal obligations.  Companies can challenge the proposed contract by appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority. If they do not appeal, then they are accepting the contract and have to deliver the regulated outputs, whatever the cost. Failure to deliver in one five-year period does not mean that the previous contract can be renegotiated. Indeed, serious failings should lead to additional penalties. So Feargal Sharkey is right to challenge Ofwat’s draft decisions (Ofwat accused of showing ‘contempt’ to customers over water bill price rises, 11 July) if the regulator has effectively reopened the previous contract. That is an empirical question that careful examination of the draft determinations (and final determinations of the previous review) can answer.

      "A solar energy project developer linked to Thames Water is to be liquidated and its staff made redundant as the crisis engulfing the debt-laden water supplier puts strain on its complex corporate structure. Trinzic Operations Ltd, which is ultimately owned by Thames’s parent company Kemble Water Holdings, is to be voluntarily shut down, the Guardian can reveal. Sources said Trinzic, which is based in London, is subject to a members’ voluntary liquidation – when a solvent company is shut down – and Kemble is attempting to recoup more than £25m from the business.   Related: World’s biggest floating solar farm powers up outside London   A filing with the Insolvency Service shows that 37 employees will be made redundant at the company, which was set up to develop floating solar projects on Thames sites to boost the company’s renewable energy generation. The job losses start at the end of the month. Some employees may be given roles at Thames. It is understood Thames told Trinzic it did not plan to transfer any assets to Trinzic or enter any further commercial arrangements with it after a U-turn by investors on £500m of pledged funding in March. Despite efforts to find further investment, Trinzic will now be wound down. A source close to Thames said that Kemble was “urgently” attempting to recover funds from Trinzic, as consultants at Alvarez & Marsal work with Kemble to assess its options. It is unclear whether, after the cash needed for restructuring is spent, any funds recovered from Trinzic will be distributed to external shareholders. Senior executives at Trinzic are understood to be in line for large payouts – in excess of 12 months’ salary. The majority of staff are expected to leave with redundancy payments worth at least three months’ pay. Thames Water is laden with £15.2bn of debt and said last week that it only has sufficient funding to run its operations until June next year. If it collapses, it is expected to be temporarily nationalised. Regulator Ofwat has put Thames into a form of special measures. The Guardian revealed in April that a development company that sells off land no longer needed by Thames, Kennet Properties, paid out a £14.5m dividend in the year to 31 March 2023 despite the difficulties faced by the wider group. At the time, sources close to Kemble said the Kennet dividend had ultimately reached Trinzic. In Thames’s complex structure, both companies sit outside the ringfenced operating company, which is regulated by Ofwat.  Interactive  The transfer of funds between the group’s web of companies have been under the spotlight as Thames struggles and the legacy of previous owners, who extracted huge dividends over a number of years, is examined. Ofwat is studying two sets of dividends, of £37.5m and £158m, approved in October and March. Trinzic was set up as Thames Water Ventures in 2021 under the stewardship of Tony Vasishta, a former executive at the telecoms company Liberty Global where he ran its real estate arm. The aim was to develop land no longer needed by the household water supplier to build projects generating solar power, storing energy and harnessing heat from the waste network to provide clean energy. The electricity generated would be sold back to Thames – a significant energy user with a £220m energy bill – at an agreed rate, cutting its costs and carbon emissions in the process. However, documents seen by the Guardian from April show that Thames believed Trinzic’s progress is “significantly behind” its original forecast. The venture was supposed to produce nearly 4,000 megawatt hours of electricity by June 2024, but it was on track to produce less than 1,000MWh by that point, the document said. Thames had already scrapped a target to hit net zero by 2030. An initial seven project sites were due to be transferred between 2020 and 2025, funded by the regulated Thames Water Utilities Ltd “with a view to sell to Trinzic upon completion”, documents said. However, they said that a contractor had “raised concerns about TW’s financial position”, causing delays. Delays were expected to sites in Little Marlow, Iver South and Swindon, it said. Sources said that executives at Thames and Trinzic had struggled to find a commercial model which benefited both parties, with Thames concerned it was taking on too much risk as they attempted to agree a 25-year power deal. Kemble declined to comment.\n",
      "The first real test of Labour’s hardline approach to public spending has surfaced within a week of the party taking office – and it is a big one. The issue is child poverty and in particular the two-child benefit limit introduced by the Conservatives in April 2017. This prevents households from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or any subsequent child born after this date. For good reason, the two-child limit is loathed by many Labour MPs because while having no impact on the number of children families have, it has had the predictable result of increasing poverty.   Related: Labour pressed to end two-child benefit cap with 1.6m youngsters affected   The Resolution Foundation thinktank says the number of families affected by the policy has increased from 70,000 to 450,000 in the past six years and that a third of its impact is yet to come. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) says the two-child limit can cost households up to £3,455 a year – a massive hit to family budgets. Child poverty is at its highest ever level, and Labour says it has “an ambitious strategy” for reducing it. Currently, this ambitious strategy does not extend to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, even though CPAG says doing so would lift 300,000 children out of poverty at a cost of £1.7bn a year. No other single measure the government could take would be as cost-effective in reducing the number of children living below the breadline. Labour’s line is that scrapping the two-child limit is something not currently budgeted for in its programme, so abolition will have to wait until there is money to spare. The argument is that this would open the floodgates to a host of other demands. This might make short-term sense but it is still misguided. The two-child cap will not survive five years of a Labour government with such a commanding parliamentary majority, and so it is a question of when, not if, the policy originally brought in by George Osborne will be canned. Delaying that decision condemns more children to a life of misery and want. There is an economic case for a more generous approach to welfare – poor families tend to spend more of their income than rich families – but there is also a moral dimension. Needlessly pushing more children into hardship is plain wrong. Finally, £1.7bn is a tiny sum in the context of a £2.7tn economy, and there are plenty of ways the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, could find it without any difficulty. As the tax expert Richard Murphy has shown, taxing capital gains at the same rate as income would net the Treasury £12bn a year, while restricting tax relief on pensions to the basic rate of income tax would raise a further £14.5bn. Removing the losses the Bank of England makes on its gilt holdings from the way the government’s debt rule is calculated would raise an estimated £20bn, according to the consultancy Oxford Economics. Labour has been keen to do nothing – and say nothing – that might rattle the financial markets, and a degree of prudence makes sense. There are, though, limits to that approach. Reeves has made much of how Britain is living in an age of insecurity, and you don’t get much more insecure than a family suffering a benefit cut in excess of £3,000 a year. The two-child cap should go without delay.\n",
      "Some 91% of the 1,290 business owners recently surveyed by the employee scheduling software maker Homebase said that they were happy with their jobs. Who are these happy people? And why are they so darned happy? It’s not the small business story we usually hear. The National Federation of Independent Businesses says small business owners’ optimism has been below average for 29 months and their uncertainty is the highest it’s been since 2020. Small businesses are “struggling” to make rent and “racking up” credit card debt. Many are “facing recession”, some say they “can’t survive” and others say they’re “feeling the pinch” or “stuck in an economic nightmare”. My clients complain to me all the time. They say their employees don’t show up to work. They tell me their suppliers don’t ship supplies on time. They have customers that haggle away their profits, delay their payments or simply don’t pay at all. Their accountants tell them to pay taxes with money that’s already been spent on inventory. They grapple with health insurance, workers’ compensation, logistics, duties, levies, finance fees, commissions and all the other little costs that add up to big expenses. They generally work long hours in dusty, dirty industrial complexes. They hate their competitors and their competitors hate them. And yet with all of these challenges, all of these headaches, all of these concerns, the Homebase survey says that basically all of them are happy? Is this possible? Yes, it is.   Related: What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?   Those same clients of mine who complain, kvetch and carp? The fact is they wouldn’t have it any other way. Even with all these headaches, most wouldn’t have it any other way. They enjoy running their businesses. They would never go back to being an employee for someone else. Happiness is relative. And they’re relatively happy. Is it because they’re “passionate” or “fulfilled” or “making a difference” or “changing the world”? That’s what those dreaming of starting up a business say … until they quickly realize that it’s a cold, hard world out there. Most of the business owners I know aren’t “entrepreneurs”. They’re not “launching a startup” or “pursuing their dreams”. They’re making sandwiches, fixing car engines, mowing lawns, fixing roofs and pouring cement. They’re driving trucks, cutting paperboard, distributing machinery parts and installing pipes. Many are doing this out of necessity, not out of choice. But that’s OK. They’re still happy. Is it because of money that they’re so happy? Definitely not. Sure, we read about the zillionaires who started out of their parents’ garages. But this only happens to one in a zillion. Most small business owners earn an average of $100,000 per year, far less than what many could make as an executive in corporate America. Plus, they wouldn’t have to worry about their health insurance, retirement and where the next check is coming from. And yet they’re happy. Why? It’s because of control. Like most people running a business, I can deal with all the bullshit, all the headaches and all the stresses. I can deal with the hours, the responsibilities and the risk. I can deal with all of this because the decisions are mine to make. Every problem I have is owned by me. Every decision I make affects my life. My 600-plus clients are my boss, not one person. Running a small business means having more options, more choices and more flexibility with one’s life. You can choose to work 20 hours a day or not. You can choose to work at 2am because you went to your kid’s soccer game that afternoon. My father once told me that employees are no more than two weeks away from unemployment. At least as a business owner, you’ve got a little more time than that. And you have the ability to change direction. The more you can control your fate, the greater your happiness.\n",
      "Ed Davey hit the headlines for falling off a paddleboard, bungee jumping and Zumba dancing as part of his unconventional election campaign. But the Liberal Democrat leader’s attention-grabbing stunts paid off when his newly resurgent party won 72 seats, its highest total since 1923. Fresh from his triumph, Davey will be in the spotlight for a more sombre reason on Thursday, as he testifies to the public inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal. Davey, who was postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, and Pat McFadden, Labour’s new chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, are among politicians who have had responsibility for the Post Office in the past and face questioning this month. The inquiry is examining the Post Office’s policy of hounding and prosecuting branch operators for more than a decade, alleging financial shortfalls in their accounts. It has since emerged that these discrepancies were caused by IT bugs within the Post Office Horizon computer system. All three main political parties face questions over what they knew about the scandal, which gained fresh prominence after a powerful ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, documented the fight for justice waged by Sir Alan Bates. McFadden – who was Labour’s election campaign co-ordinator and is now a powerful figure in Keir Starmer’s government – will give evidence to the inquiry on Thursday. McFadden was minister for postal affairs between 2007 and 2009 under Gordon Brown. He told the BBC earlier this year that he wished he had asked more questions about Horizon. He said: “Each time an MP raised a question about this, the reply would come back from the Post Office that they thought the system was robust, they had no evidence to suggest there was anything wrong with Horizon.” But even in 2009 there were warning signs. Computer Weekly published its first article about convicted Post Office operatives in May that year, and Bates formed his Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance a few months later. Davey became postal affairs minister in the coalition government in 2010. He has faced criticism for having initially refusing a meeting with Bates that year – although the pair did meet later. Writing in the Guardian, Davey said: “I’m sorry I did not see through the Post Office’s lies – and that it took me five months to meet Alan Bates.” Two former Lib Dem leaders who held office in the coalition government will also testify this month, including ex-business secretary Sir Vince Cable.   Former minister Margot James told Channel 4 earlier this year that she wished she had done more to help post office operators   Speaking to TalkTV this year, Cable said “large numbers” of ministers had been in charge during the scandal, which he termed a “terrible failure by the British state and government”. Before leading the Lib Dems for five months in 2019, Jo Swinson was postal affairs minister between 2012 and 2013 and again in 2014 to 2015. She will answer questions on 19 July. She was in the job when forensic investigator Second Sight carried out a review of the Horizon IT system and told parliament in July 2013 that its report had found “no evidence of system-wide problems with the Horizon software.” She has since said she had been misled. The toughest questioning is likely to be reserved for politicians who held office under Conservative governments from 2015, when the scandal was regularly hitting the headlines. In 2015 BBC’s Panorama highlighted concerns with Horizon and by 2016 Bates and 554 other subpostmasters had begun high court action against the Post Office. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, a junior minister between 2014 and 2016, is due to testify on 23 July. The inquiry has already heard that in 2015, Neville-Rolfe asked Tim Parker, who was taking over as chair of the Post Office, to look at the Horizon scandal with “fresh eyes” and examine concerns regarding the IT system. Parker has told the inquiry that he commissioned a barrister-led review, but its 2016 report was not shared with the Post Office board and the government was only briefed orally because of legal concerns. Greg Clark, business secretary between 2016 and 2019, will testify in late July, as will along with former ministers Margot James and Kelly Tolhurst. James told Channel 4 earlier this year that she wished she had done more to help operatives. Clark, James and Tolhurst all held government posts during the landmark 2019 high court case at which the Post Office continued to argue that its Horizon IT system was reliable and post office operators must be to blame for shortfalls. Davey and McFadden have been contacted for comment. • The headline of this article was amended on 14 July 2024. An earlier version referred to “three former Liberal Democrat leaders”. This has been changed to “Ed Davey and former Lib Dem leaders”.\n",
      "For a chancellor targeting a decade in power, Rachel Reeves is in a hurry. After 14 years in the wilderness for Labour, and several centuries of Britain awaiting its first female chancellor, it’s not surprising she is keen to get on with the job. So far, two ideas have predominated: blaming the Conservatives for the worst economic inheritance since the second world war, and laying the foundations for national renewal at breakneck speed. Reeves says there isn’t any time to waste to get Britain on track for the highest sustained levels of growth in the G7. But it is a task that will involve tough trade-offs and challenges, and will come to define Keir Starmer’s government. In the scramble to look busy, ministers have been hurriedly working behind the scenes to reshape the institutions of Whitehall and get the government machine aimed at Reeves’s primary objective. One quick win was the creation of a new council of economic advisers, housed within the Treasury and led by top London School of Economics academics John Van Reenen and Anna Valero.  More changes are due in Wednesday’s king’s speech, including the government’s legislative plans for workers’ rights, planning reform, the NHS and Great British Energy, Ed Miliband’s prized low-carbon power company. Sources say we can expect a big announcement on infrastructure, too. The government is keen to show it is committed to getting mega-projects built after the stop-start failures of the Tory years. There is a rush to finalise plans, including the potential abolition of the National Infrastructure Commission, which would be replaced with a new body.  Elsewhere, Starmer is setting up “delivery boards” packed with external experts for his five key “missions” for government: growth, energy, crime, education and health.  The challenge, though, is whether the reforms will succeed in getting Britain’s economy back on track. Successive governments have carried out similar tyre changes on the Whitehall motor, only to end up with the wheels spinning on the road to prosperity. This time Labour is preparing to rely heavily on the private sector, in acknowledgment of tight constraints on the public finances. After the Tories’ Brexit-era “fuck business” approach, there is obvious latent potential to unlock. However, the government ought to be realistic about how far this might go. For decades, the UK has trailed comparable rich nations on business investment – a fact made worse by the economic vandalism of austerity, Brexit, and the churn of Conservative prime ministers.  Figures from Capital Economics show total investment in the UK has shrunk from 26% of GDP in the late 1980s to 18% today – a bigger decline than the rest of the G7. That suggests Labour is aiming to get from the bottom of the investment league table to the top: the equivalent of Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016, a 5,000-1 dream come true.    Labour’s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge   Bringing about stability will help. The UK now stands as a beacon of relative calm in an increasingly volatile world. There will be further tailwinds as inflation cools, and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates soon.  Reeves’s new national wealth fund could help encourage investment in some certain parts of the economy, as part of a broader modern industrial strategy – details of which are said to be in the pipeline. However, Labour’s manifesto implies cuts to public investment as a share of GDP from the current starting point, putting even more weight on the private sector to lead the charge in Britain’s unlikely Leicester-inspired campaign.  Unlocking more private capital could require the government to be bolder with its own investment plans. To do so without deviating from Labour’s tax promises, Reeves could use the review of public spending she commissioned last week to pave the way for changes in the government’s fiscal rules.  The chancellor is also said to be keen to revamp the Office for Budget Responsibility, including a request for reports on the long-term impact of capital spending decisions. Currently, the Treasury watchdog publishes five-year forecasts. But this fails to capture the benefits from big infrastructure programmes, which can take longer to materialise. Such a change could help strengthen the case for investment. There is ample evidence that this might be a good idea, including from Van Reenen and Valero, who were among the authors of a report earlier this year calling for a temporary boost to public borrowing to drive investment in sustainable technologies and infrastructure. “[It] would prove cost-effective and beneficial to living standards and economic competitiveness by increasing productivity and economic growth,” they wrote. In the early days of Labour’s putative decade in power, this could have the biggest effect on growth.\n",
      "Culture lovers flocked to the Hockley Social Club this year to marvel at the Birmingham Royal Ballet performing highlights from Tchaikovsky’s Sleeping Beauty. On Sunday, it will be the balletic grace of local lad Jude Bellingham that awakens the spirits of 1,000 football fans gathering to watch England battle Spain in the Euro 2024 final. The success of the Three Lions heralds a badly needed money-spinner for the venue, one that is particularly poignant because it came courtesy of a last-minute winner from another Birmingham hero, Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins. “We were booked up within minutes of the final whistle going,” says Jack Brabant, a Villa fan and director of the social club and its sister venue, Digbeth Dining Club. “It was a flood, we were just watching the ticker going up and we had to close off bookings completely.” The British Beer & Pubs Association (BBPA) has estimated that Gareth Southgate’s men reaching the final means British bar staff will pull 10m extra pints, worth £48m. The broader hospitality sector stands to enjoy a boost of between £700m and £800m across the whole of the tournament, according to the trade body UK Hospitality. The upper end of the estimate is dependent on good weather and an England victory that would see fans take full advantage of government-approved late licensing, until 1am. That is why the final is “more than just a match; it is a beacon of hope”, according to the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, Michael Kill. The hospitality sector has had a rough time over the past four years, starting with the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced pubs, bars and clubs to shut their doors for weeks at a time. Successive blows have choked off the sector’s recovery, with more than 500 pubs closing for good in 2023. Now, Euro 2024 offers the biggest tournament takings boost since the 2018 World Cup. Covid restrictions were still in place for Euro 2020 [held in 2021] while Qatar 2022 was staged in winter, cannibalising pre-Christmas sales, and matches mostly kicked off during the day. “I can’t emphasis how important this is,” says Duncan Sambrook, managing director of Sambrook’s Brewery, which will be screening the final on five giants screens at its taproom in London’s Wandsworth. “It’s all been doom and gloom in our industry, one crisis after another. Staffing crisis, followed by energy crisis, followed by the cost of living crisis.” England’s success has come just when the sector needs it most, particularly given the poor summer weather so far. Sambrook’s takings on Wednesday, during the semi-final, were four times what they would normally be. Sunday’s surge could be even bigger on what would normally be a relatively quiet night. The taproom has arranged its seating to create a “stadium feel” and staff – in more than twice their normal numbers – will be wearing specially made shirts with their names on the back, emulating the sporting stars on the screen. Extra brewing began weeks ago, to ensure that the taps wouldn’t run dry if England – or in theory Scotland – made it to the latter stages. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, says the average sales uplift across the sector had been 30% on match days in the group stages but has since accelerated to 40%. She is hoping the sporting party will last beyond the tournament. “People are marketing it as a summer of sport. Yes you’ve got the Euros but on the back of that people are coming in to watch the cricket and lots of pubs are advertising the Olympics.” The sport-loving crowd has diversified too, with the triumphs of England’s women’s team broadening the customer base. The audience for the Lionesses, says Nicholls, brought in more extra revenue than the Six Nations rugby tournament. At Hockley Social Club, some of the ballet connoisseurs might even put in an appearance on Sunday. “The great thing about when teams do well is that it brings out the occasional fans, but they don’t necessarily want to be part of that beer-throwing laddish behaviour,” says Brabant. The venue has even married culture with football, with musicians from Birmingham Symphony Orchestra playing pieces including Nessun Dorma, the soundtrack to England’s agonising semi-final defeat at Italia 90. Like the title of Puccini’s aria, the hospitality sector is hoping that, come Sunday, nobody will be sleeping.\n",
      "It’s time. The summer holidays are upon us and that sunshine jaunt booked back in January is suddenly imminent. But as the first travel chaos stories of the season start to pepper the headlines – a power cut here, a baggage meltdown there – clouds of anxiety can gather over daydreams of beach bliss. In the post-pandemic rush to head overseas, the air and travel industry uncovered ever more new things to go wrong. In 2022 came the realisation that there were simply not enough staff for the flights sold to take cooped-up Brits briefly off the island. Then last summer culminated in an unprecedented air traffic meltdown affecting tens of thousands of passengers.   Related: Flights from two Manchester airport terminals cancelled after power cut   But the appetite for travel continues unabated: Stansted and Manchester airports had record numbers in June, while Heathrow saw its busiest ever day on 30 June. As ever more flights crowd into the airspace, and airlines sweat their assets with swift turnarounds and relentless activity, the potential for knock-on cancellations and delays is vast. As the lottery people like to say, “it could be you”, and indeed, it could: it’s more likely you will be stranded in a foreign airport or mysteriously sans baggage than win a pile of cash. Gratifyingly, the odds are still small. So how is 2024 shaping up – and what can airlines, or the nervous traveller, do to further minimise the risks? Extreme weather has been arguably the biggest headache for the travel industry so far, disrupting flights and threatening to blight summers one way or another, through foreign heatwave hell, staycation high water or an alarmingly early start to the hurricane season. That may have contributed to the rise in late bookings reported by the holiday firm Jet2, as people assess the alternatives. The extreme heat that affected much of southern Europe did not appear to deter bookings last year, according to easyJet. Even late summer wildfires in Rhodes and the warnings for tourists amid Greece’s 40C June heat are still pitted against the unusually wet and cold British summer. While holidaymakers may find something tolerable in between, the weather has been increasing disruption to flights. Between the peaks and troughs, summer storms are a growing issue with almost 48% more delays in Europe attributed to adverse weather in 2023 than in 2022, according to the Brussels air traffic organisation Eurocontrol. British Airways was among those making cancellations two weekends ago, with rerouting due to storms in which two of their planes were struck by lightning. Wet weather on returns home also has an impact: air traffic controllers increase the gaps between planes to ensure safe landings, limiting the number that can fly back in. Air traffic control more broadly has become a vexed issue for airlines, with strikes abroad and more recent troubles from staff shortages at Gatwick’s tower. Most ill-timed and inexplicable was a gremlin in the UK’s air traffic control system that halted flights for hours last August bank holiday: due either to a “black swan event”, according to those responsible at Nats (national air traffic services), or “engineers sitting at home in their jimmy-jams”, according to Ryanair’s furious boss, Michael O’Leary. Either way, Nats has worked to ensure that combination of events should never recur, while Gatwick said Nats had “successfully increased the number of controllers and assured us there will be the required resources to deliver this year’s busy summer schedules”. Staff shortages in multiple areas of aviation was the overwhelming story of 2022’s troubled summer, as airports and airlines struggled to recruit enough security line workers and baggage handlers in particular. Manchester airport was the scene of some of the worst queues, and there was trouble at Heathrow and elsewhere with passengers also held in long security and check-in delays. EasyJet and BA were among those forced to cancel thousands of flights in advance to try to pre-empt disruption.   Related: E-gates back online after chaos at Heathrow and other UK airports   Extensive recruitment has filled those gaps. A Heathrow spokesperson said: “We’re fully staffed and as prepared as we can be.” And airport bosses stress that many of those raw recruits are now fully trained with a year’s experience behind them: Manchester airport last month saw 97% of passengers through security in less than 15 minutes, despite a power cut that meant a day of delay and cancellations. The last two years have also seen a rise in aviation strikes – with everyone from firefighters to refuellers seeking to follow overworked frontline staff in boosting low pay during the cost of living crisis. Recent disputes involving some workers at Gatwick, and Aer Lingus pilots, have for now been resolved. The impact for travellers has frequently been lower than threatened – even Border Force strikes last year delayed few people. But passengers can be cheered by the news that some of the most unpredictable and disruptive strikes, the dreaded wildcat actions by French air traffic controllers, have been rendered unlikely this summer due to a generous pre-Paris Olympics settlement. The Olympics have also ensured that the EU has delayed its entry-exit system until at least October – now a headache for another summer, particularly on the ground for the Port of Dover and Eurostar, both making extensive preparations. Dover nonetheless has warned travellers to expect “exceptionally busy” summer weekends this year due to the Olympics increasing traffic by up to 30%, leading to a two-hour processing time for ferries. Back at the airports, hopes are high for a smoother year. Aviation insiders maintain that a number of lurid headlines are overblown. Referring to a recent story depicting alleged chaos, one exasperated executive said: “That’s a picture of an orderly queue. That’s what an airport looks like.” And the stories can be self-fulfilling: during the staffing troubles of 2022, many holidaymakers took to arriving even earlier, filling terminals long before check-ins opened. As a source at a major carrier put it: “We’ve had a few difficult weekends. When things happens at the last minute it’s not predictable … There are lots of different challenging external factors. We’re always going to have things beyond our control.” To try to mitigate disruption, easyJet and BA have made large investments in their control centres at Luton and Heathrow to provide quicker and swifter responses to events. More automation and AI is being used to assess the availability of crew and planes to swiftly resolve the complex permutations of who and what can be reallocated, where, as need arises. Even if a new source of travel chaos is surely waiting in the wings, the industry is confident it is in a better place. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “The summer season has got off to a positive start and, notwithstanding recent adverse weather and air traffic control challenges across Europe, airlines are looking forward to another busy summer taking millions of customers away on their holidays.” Another airline director urged: “Just make sure they buy travel insurance.”\n",
      "Hackers stole call and text message records on “nearly all” of AT&T’s customers, the communications giant disclosed on Friday. The immense data breach took records of tens of millions of people’s phone use from around a six-month period in 2022, along with a single day in January 2023. According to AT&T, a suspect has been apprehended. AT&T, which revealed the hack in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, stated that the data includes records of which numbers customers texted or called over a certain period of time, as well as the number of times the calls took place. The data doesn’t include other kinds of personal information associated with the numbers or information on what was said during the interactions. “The data does not contain the content of calls or texts, personal information such as social security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information,” AT&T said in the filing. The company stated in its annual report last year that it had over 127m devices connected on its network, but did not state in the SEC filing exactly how many of these were part of the data breach. The Federal Communications Commission announced on Friday that it had opened an investigation into the hack, while AT&T stated that it was taking action to prevent future attacks. “AT&T has taken additional cybersecurity measures in response to this incident including closing off the point of unlawful access,” the company said in its filing. “AT&T will provide notice to its current and former impacted customers.” Although the stolen data did not include the names associated with the phone numbers, that information would probably be easy to reverse-engineer using online data brokers and public records. The hack also affected non-AT&T customers of mobile virtual network operators who were using the company’s wireless network. The company learned about the hack on 19 April, according to the filing, and is working with law enforcement efforts to find the perpetrators. It follows another hack of AT&T’s data that it disclosed in March, which did contain the personal information, including social security numbers, of millions of users. Cyber-attacks have continued to target major companies across industries throughout this year, with hackers sometimes holding data ransom or releasing it online. Ticketmaster is still reeling from a hack in May that affected about 560 million customers, and has resulted in hackers leaking ticketing information online while demanding millions of dollars in ransom payments.\n",
      "Carpetright, one of the UK’s biggest flooring retailers, has filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator, putting 1,800 jobs at risk as it races to secure extra funding. The company filed the notice with the high court to appoint administrators while it worked to finalise new investment to protect its long-term future. The move gives the company 10 days protection from creditors while negotiations continue and Carpetright tries to secure a future for its 272 stores, which employ 1,852 people in the UK. The retailer will continue to trade. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been lined up as possible administrators but not yet been appointed. High court records show that Carpetright, advised by the law firm Travers Smith, filed the notice on Friday. The retailer has been struggling in recent months as consumers cut back on spending on furniture and furnishings due to the lacklustre economy and the cost of living crisis. Carpetright also was hit by a cyber-attack that disrupted trade in April and subsequently affected its plans to restructure. Kevin Barrett, the chief executive of its parent company Nestware Holdings, said: “We remain focused on securing external investment to ensure as few customers and colleagues are impacted as possible. “They are our main priority and we are taking all appropriate action to make sure they are informed and supported through this process. We have begun promising conversations with interested parties that are moving in the right direction, encouraging us that Carpetright has a viable future.” Carpetright is one of the largest flooring retailers in the UK and is part of Meditor Group, a hedge fund, after being sold in 2019 for £15m. At that time Carpetright, which was once a FTSE 250 company, had been struggling with difficult trading conditions and tough competition from its rival Tapi, which was set up by the family of Lord Harris, the founder of Carpetright. Separately, Unilever plans to cut as many as 3,200 roles in Europe by the end of 2025, according to details of a company-wide call first reported by the Financial Times on Friday. The cuts are part of an overhaul at Unilever, which has brands from Marmite to Domestos bleach, announced in March. Overall, it is cutting 7,500 jobs globally and spinning off its ice-cream division as part of the revamp, which is aimed at saving about €800m (£684m) over the next three years.\n",

Britain risks a tech “talent drain” to the US if British pension funds fail to back the sector, according to the co-founder of a UK chipmaker that has announced its sale to Japan’s SoftBank. Nigel Toon, the co-founder and chief executive of Graphcore, said domestic pension funds were giving inadequate support to private businesses in the UK. “They’re certainly not investing in private companies here in the UK,” he said. “How can we expect businesses to grow without those pools of capital unless they secure funding from other sources?” As well as British pension fund investors missing out on the benefits, said Toon, there was a risk that UK tech talent is lured away by foreign investors that have stepped in to provide growth funding. US-based venture capital firms could, for instance, require British startups to move across the Atlantic, the Graphcore boss said.

Take care – JK  Updated at 9.25pm BST    2.58pm BST   The UK justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has just announced the release of 1,000 prisoners in an attempt to ease the pressures faced by overcrowded prisons. James Timpson, now minister of state for prisons since resigning from his chief executive post at Timpson Group earlier this week, has long pushed for reform of prisons. He has made headlines for his radical approach to business including hiring ex-convicts, writes Jonathan Yeboah.   Related: Releasing prisoners early ‘only way to avoid disaster’, says justice secretary – UK politics live   The company was founded in 1865 by William Timpson and has since operated as a family business spanning through five generations. It has long specialised in shoe repairs, and has also expanded into key cutting, watch and phone repairs.  A key Timpson principle has been giving people a second opportunity in life, and it started hiring former prisoners in 2002. Of its 5,600 staff, 10% are ex-offenders. It does not require its applicants to apply with a CV, rather, they look for “fun, interesting, snappy” people, James has said.

Last year, it made profits of £38.3m. The group owns seven subsidiaries which vary from photo printing to dry cleaning to locksmith services. Branch managers and their teams at Timpson are actively encouraged to offer discounts and even free services to customers. Remarkably, 4% of Timpson’s transactions are done at no charge. “Giving things away is the most profitable thing we do. Customers always remember kindness,” the company asserts.

Along with other airlines, the company is struggling with high labour and operating costs coupled with weaker revenues per passenger because of pressure on ticket prices. The share price fell nearly 4% and later traded 2.4% lower, pulling down British Airways owner IAG by 2.8% and Air France-KLM by 2.1%. Lufthansa said its adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell to €686m in the three months to June, from €1.1bn a year earlier. It reports full second-quarter results on 31 July. It now expects a full-year profit of between €1.4bn and €1.8bn, down from its previous estimate of €2.2bn. It is launching a turnaround programme affecting Lufthansa and its regional carrier Cityline.  A market-related decline in yields in all traffic regions – especially in Asia – had a negative impact. Lufthansa Airlines is particularly affected by the challenges posed by the negative market trend and by inefficiencies in the flight operations of Lufthansa and Cityline, also due to delayed aircraft delivery. It is becoming increasingly challenging for Lufthansa Airlines to break even for the full year. To counteract this, a comprehensive turnaround program is being launched.      2.12pm BST  Airbus launches cost-cutting drive including hiring freeze  Airbus has launched a new cost-cutting drive including a hiring freeze in its planemaking business, following recent cuts in production targets.

Holding interest rates too high for too long would threaten economic growth and jobs, he told Congress on Tuesday. The US is “no longer an overheated economy”, Powell said, adding that its job market has “cooled considerably” from its surge after the early damage inflicted by the pandemic.

Read wrote in a note to staff that he and the board agreed he should step back over the summer to prepare for the next phase of the inquiry, which will look at current practices at the Post Office, and begins in September. Deputy chief executive Owen Woodley will take charge of day-to-day activities for the next seven weeks until the end of August, Read said.The note, sent yesterday, said:   It is vitally important that we demonstrate the changes we have made and give confidence to the inquiry and the country at large that ‘nothing like this could happen again’. Following a discussion with Nigel [Railton, incoming chair] and the board, we have agreed that I should give my entire attention to the task of preparing the business for Phase 7.  More than 700 subpostmasters were wrongly prosecuted by the Post Office and handed criminal convictions between 1999 and 2015 because the Japanese firm Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon IT system made it look as though money was missing at their branches. Read succeeded former boss Paula Vennells, who this year forfeited her CBE following public anger over her handling of the Horizon crisis. She testified to the inquiry over three days in May, in a sometimes tearful set of evidence sessions about her conduct.In February, the business and trade committee of MPs expressed a lack of confidence in Read’s leadership, accusing him of giving misleading evidence. He has also denied a claim made by former chair of the Post Office Henry Staunton that he had threatened to resign unless he got paid more. He was “exonerated of all misconduct allegations” following a report into his behaviour earlier this year. The external report, which the Post Office has not released, was said by Staunton to contain allegations about Read’s “conduct and lack of his management of the many governance and compliance issues”. The Post Office said at the time that the review cleared him of any misconduct claims, and that he had the full backing of the board to continue to lead the business.  Updated at 1.57pm BST    1.00pm BST   Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, said:  JP Morgan’s results showed us two things: First, investment banking and equities trading did really well compared to last year.  Secondly, we see Main Street banking beginning to sputter. Provisions for credit losses were up significantly, showing us that JP Morgan is expecting to see a rough patch in the US economy. Also, there was a big increase in interest expense, which grew far more quickly than interest income. Nevertheless, JP Morgan has navigated a challenging interest rate environment very well.       12.57pm BST  JPMorgan profit jumps 25% on investment banking fees, Wells Fargo profit dips  A number of big US banks have kicked off the earnings season. JPMorgan Chase posted a 25% rise in second-quarter profit, lifted by rising investment banking fees and an accounting gain of $8bn from a share exchange deal. The largest US bank made a profit of $18.15bn in the three months to 30 June, compared with $14.5bn a year earlier. It benefited from a plan to exchange some of its shares in Visa, the world’s biggest payment network. Wall Street banks have benefited from an increase in companies raising capital in the debt and equity markets, and an uptick in fee income from advising on M&A deals. However, chief executive Jamie Dimon cautioned:  While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown.  Next, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale.  The bank’s shares dipped by 0.6% in trading before the opening bell. Wells Fargo fared less well, reporting lower quarterly profits because of higher deposit costs amid intense competition for customers’ money, sending its shares down by more than 5% in pre-market trading. The bank’s net income fell to $4.91bn between April and June, from $4.94bn a year earlier. Net interest income, the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays out for deposits, slid by 9% to $11.9bn, which was worse than expected. Average deposit costs jumped to 1.84% from 0.71%.     12.33pm BST  China posts record trade surplus as firms rush to beat tariffs  Here’s our full story on the China trade figures: China posted a record $99bn (£76.4bn) trade surplus last month amid signs of importers bringing forward orders to beat higher tariffs on goods from the world’s second biggest economy. The latest official figures from Beijing showed exports growing at their fastest rate in 15 months, while the weakness of China’s domestic economy resulted in falling imports. The size of China’s trade surplus was far bigger than the $85bn expected by the financial markets and comes at a time of heightened concern in developed countries about Chinese exports. Higher US tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and other hi-tech products come into force on 1 August, while higher EU import duties on Chinese electric vehicles came into force earlier this month.

The FTSE 100 company, which makes well-known consumer products such as Marmite and Dove soap, has come under pressure from shareholders including activist investor Nelson Peltz. It told senior executives about the planned cuts on Wednesday, according to details of a company-wide call shared with the Financial Times.  The job cuts are part of Unilever’s “productivity programme” announced in March that includes up to 7,500 job losses globally. The company employs between 10,000 and 11,000 office-based staff in Europe.  Constantina Tribou, a chief human resources officer, said during the video call, according to the FT:  The expected net impact in roles in Europe between now and the end of 2025 is in the range of 3,000 to 3,200 roles.  In March, the company also announced that it would spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about €800m (£672m) over the next three years. At the time, Hein Schumacher, who was appointed as chief executive in January 2023, and took over from Alan Jope last spring, said there would be some job cuts at Unilever’s head office in London, and some at business units in other countries.     12.05pm BST  Sterling closes in on $1.30 level; stocks extend rally  The pound has risen by 0.4% against the dollar today, hitting a high of $1.2962 and closing in on the $1.30 level. Investors are attracted to the UK currency following Labour’s landslide victory a week ago, amid political instability in France, where Sunday’s elections resulted in a hung parliament. The pound has also been lifted by strong UK GDP data yesterday combined with a surprise monthly fall in US consumer prices and a lower-than-expected annual inflation rate of 3%. This led to investors pilling on bets of a September interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve, and dragged the dollar down against major currencies. Oil prices are rising, with Brent crude up by 0.55% to $85.88 a barrel, on expectations that Fed rate cuts would stimulate demand for crude in the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer. European shares have extended their rally, on the back of growing expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates soon. The FTSE 100 index in London is 25 points, or 0.3%, ahead at 8,249 while the German Dax has gained 0.37%, the French CAC has climbed 0.66% and Italy’s FTSE MiB rose 0.56%.

Since England’s 2-1 win against the Netherlands on Wednesday, supporters with deep pockets have been scouring the web for flights to Berlin or nearby cities and trying to secure a ticket for the final, the latter said to be changing hands for £2,500. At home, with the weather gods promising some overdue sunshine, high street retailers including Tesco and Marks & Spencer expect food and drink sales to rocket between now and Sunday as hosts stock up for barbecues and viewing parties. Fans who prefer a pub atmosphere have rushed to book seats at venues showing the game. In the moments after Ollie Watkins scored the winner on Wednesday evening, the number of reservations processed by the bookings website DesignMyNight soared to 16 a second, compared with the normal rate of 1.4.

According to new data, what once seemed like a pandemic necessity has become the new norm for many Americans. Every year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases the results of its American time use survey, which asks Americans how much time they spend doing various activities, from work to leisure. The most recent survey results, released at the end of June, show that the same percentage of employed people who did at least some remote work in 2023 is the same percentage as those who did remote work in 2022. In other words, it’s the first stabilization in the data since before the pandemic, when only a small percentage of workers did remote work, and a sign that remote work is here to stay.

The game starts at 8pm and could last until 11pm if it goes to penalties. In preparation, some companies are offering workers early finishes if they are due to be on shift on the evening of the game, while others are telling employees they can come in late on Monday. The supermarket chain Lidl, a sponsor of the tournament, said it would open all its stores in England an hour later on Monday so workers could enjoy some post-match celebrations. Ryan McDonnell, the chief executive of Lidl in Great Britain, said:   We know how much this game means to England fans and we want to ensure that our colleagues have the chance to celebrate such a significant moment in English football history.

Labour will miss its target of delivering 1.5m new homes this parliament without an emergency cash injection into the affordable housing sector, providers have warned. Housing associations and councils have written to deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, saying her promise to deliver “the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation” will be impossible unless there are urgent interventions to fix the financial pressures providers face. The warning comes as new figures, shared exclusively with the Guardian, show that housing associations, the biggest developers of social housing, started just 32,705 homes in 2023-24. This is down 30% on the 2022-23 figures. The letter – signed by the National Housing Federation, which represents 600 housing associations, and the Local Government Association – said that capped income, crippling cuts and soaring costs had decimated providers’ budgets, reducing the amount of homes they could build.

The Bristol-based startup’s products are focused on artificial intelligence and it has been acquired by the powerful Japanese tech investor for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Graphcore warned that there was a “material uncertainty” over its survival and that it needed fresh funding by May 2024. Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, alluded to Graphcore’s problems as he backed the deal, saying it was a “welcome end to the uncertainty that has faced Graphcore and its employees”. Graphcore is the latest UK tech company to be bought by SoftBank, which acquired the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm for £24bn in 2016.

What follows sounds like thunder and lightning. It is a human-induced storm in a massive, ceramic-lined cup, holding 140 tonnes of rapidly melting steel. The plant, owned by Spain’s Celsa, melts scrap steel using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn the metal to liquid. The glowing steel is then ready to be cast, twisted and crushed into the rods used to reinforce concrete. The plant’s million tonnes of annual output have been used in projects ranging from buildings such as the Wembley Stadium and Shard, to infrastructure projects including the Elizabeth tube line and Hinkley Point nuclear power station.   Related: Steelmakers fire up to swap centuries-old reliance on coal for electric arc furnaces   The electric arc furnace is a sign of the future for the rest of the UK industry. Tata Steel, based in Port Talbot, and British Steel, at Scunthorpe, are each planning to switch from polluting blast furnaces to the much greener electric technology. The plans will cut emissions, but also involve thousands of jobs losses, including 2,800 in south Wales. Pushing for investment The new Labour government has promised to renegotiate a £500m subsidy, agreed under the Conservatives, for Indian-owned Tata Steel to make the switch and so cut out nearly 2% of the UK’s carbon emissions. Tata tapped the last iron from one blast furnace hours after voters gave Labour a landslide victory at the general election this month, and plans to close its second furnace in September. However, the UK’s newly installed business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has offered more money in the hope of saving jobs. Labour has pledged another £2.5bn investment in the UK steel industry. A large chunk is expected to go to Tata Steel on top of the £500m already agreed.     11.05am BST  Labour summons bosses of worst-performing train operators to meetings  Labour has summoned the bosses of some of the worst-performing train operators, including Avanti West Coast and TransPennine, for meetings next week as it seeks to rapidly reform the railways and reset industrial relations. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, will bring in Network Rail route directors to attend all talks with the train companies, signalling the move towards an integrated railway. After Haigh vowed to “move fast and fix things”, legislation to kickstart Great British Railways is expected to be announced in the king’s speech next week, and officials are beginning work to set up the new structure before the summer parliamentary recess. Haigh has already met rail union leaders at the Department for Transport as the new government looks to facilitate an end to the long-running rail dispute. Haigh said her meetings with Mick Whelan and Mick Lynch, the general secretaries of Aslef and the RMT respectively, were a departure from “the days of antagonism and gimmicks” and the start of “an era of grownup industrial relations”.

Before the opening bell, we will get second-quarter results from big US banks -- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon are all reporting. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said:  European markets are enjoying a strong end to the week, feeding off a weaker US inflation reading than many had anticipated. While the surprise decline for both core and headline CPI initially helped lift all markets, we soon saw a rotation from big tech to more cyclical stocks. While some will fear the repercussions of a slump in big tech valuations, investors will be encouraged at the prospect of a more broad-based bullish environment for equity markets. Interest rate cuts from the likes of the ECB and the Bank of Canada may have occurred ahead of any Fed reserve easing, but the willingness to further widen that interest rate differential will be questionable given the potential outflows in capital towards the US. With that in mind the recent declines for US core PCE and CPI inflation has helped lift expectations for a September rate cut which in turn bolsters claims of similar action from the other major central banks.  Turning to the Chinese trade data, he said:  Overnight trade data released from China highlighted continued concerns for their major trade partners, with imports slumping by 2.3% over the year to June. This represents a four-month low for Chinese imports, raising concerns over those businesses and economies relying on Chinese consumption. The notable disparity between exports (8.6%) and imports (-2.3%) does highlight the relative weakness of the Chinese consumer compared to global demand trends. This should come into light once again next week with the latest GDP, retail sales and industrial production data being reported on Monday.  On the US banks, he said:  There are considerable concerns coming into this second quarter earnings season, with FactSet expecting a 10% decline in year-on-year earnings growth for banking stocks in Q2. With traders having grown accustomed to a widening disparity between the strengthening big banks and stuttering regional banks, traders will be hoping that these Wall Street giants can continue to outperform despite predictions of a more difficult environment.

Sterling is trading 0.3% higher against the dollar at $1.2946, and is up by 0.1% against the euro at €1.1890 – the highest level since August 2022. It has gained about 3% against the euro so far this year, amid political instability in France. The UK currency has been lifted by stronger-than-expected GDP figures yesterday and investors’ perception of stability and confidence in UK assets, following last week’s decisive Labour election victory. At the same time, the dollar weakened, after a surprise fall in US consumer prices last month, which prompted traders to increase bets on a September interest rate cut. The pound is the only developed market currency that has gained against the dollar this year. It has also been boosted by hawkish comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist this week. Huw Pill said recent economic data pointed towards some “upside risks to my assessment of inflation persistence,” suggesting that he is not yet convinced by the case for an August interest rate cut.

The mail pillar box bears the king’s cypher, the monogram that appears on government buildings which consists of the initials ‘C’ and ‘R’ for Charles and Rex, the Latin word for king, alongside a depiction of the crown. The first post box was introduced in the 1850s, and there are abut 115,000 in operation today. Their age can be discovered by the royal cypher they bear. The oldest dates back to the reign of Queen Victoria, Charles’ great-great-great grandmother.  Updated at 10.08am BST    9.38am BST   French politics remain in the spotlight in an otherwise light data week for the eurozone economy. Last Sunday’s elections in France resulted a hung parliament.  A strong performance by Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) came as a surprise. This hastily assembled alliance of left-wing parties unexpectedly won with 188 seats, though it fell far short of an overall majority of 289 seats. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist coalition, Ensemble (ENS), also beat expectations winning 161 seats, well ahead of the sub-100 seats suggested by some polls, and Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) came third with 142 seats – far from the absolute majority that looked possible after strong results in the first round. Ricardo Amaro, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said:  France’s election resulted in a hung parliament as we expected, though the strong performance from the left-wing alliance came as a surprise. A minority left wing government is now a possibility, but their more radical proposals would likely be blocked in parliament. We see two other alternatives. President Emmanuel Macron’s group could try to form a grand coalition of moderate left and right parties. Otherwise, Macron could try to appoint a technocratic caretaker prime minister. Neither of these scenarios are easy nor look to be politically sustainable. Moreover, all three are likely to result in policy paralysis, leaving the prospects for France’s government very uncertain. Uncertainty is also a feature of EU politics. Next European parliament’s vote on retaining Ursula von der Leyen at the helm of the European Commission is on a knife-edge. If she loses the vote, a new candidate will need to be found, though no credible alternatives have emerged so far. The EU council is likely to confirm next week that France is to be put into the so-called excessive deficit procedure, along with Italy and five other EU countries. This will oblige the new French government to come up with a credible medium-term adjustment path by September that would slash the fiscal deficit below 3% from 5.4% in 2023. But a divided Assembly will find it hard to agree on politically difficult spending cuts, meaning France is more likely to pose an early challenge to the new EU fiscal rules than to noticeably improve its fiscal outlook.      9.21am BST  Third M25 weekend closure starts tonight, affecting euro fans  Drivers are being warned to expect delays as a planned M25 closure starts tonight. This is the third of five weekend closures of the M25, which encircles London. as part of a £317m project to improve Junction 10. The AA said many major roads in the south east will be “incredibly busy,” as National Highways shuts the motorway between Junctions 10 and 11 in Surrey from 9pm on Friday to 6am on Monday. Drivers will be directed along a diversion route on A-roads. Many of those travelling to and from the UK’s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, will be affected. The closure could also disrupt many journeys to Dover by England football supporters embarking on cross-Channel trips before driving to Berlin for Sunday’s Euro 2024 final. AA patrol of the year Chris Wood said:   With many football fans changing their plans following England’s victory over Holland, it’s likely to be incredibly busy in and around London. We advise drivers to plan their journey accordingly, avoiding the west side of the M25 if possible, and to check ferry and tunnel operators’ websites for updates before setting off.  There were fears of severe congestion on diversion routes ahead of the first two planned M25 closures in March and May, but many drivers followed advice to avoid the area. National Highways senior project manager Jonathan Wade said:  The previous two closures have gone well, with significant progress being made during both. We would urge all drivers to follow the official diversion route as this is the best chance of reaching your destination in good time. Please ignore your satnavs and follow our diversion route instead. National Highways is concerned that satnavs could direct some drivers on to minor roads after leaving the M25, creating gridlock in residential areas. Shutting the motorway this weekend will enable the construction of a new bridge near Junction 10. The project, due to be completed in summer 2025, will increase the number of lanes at the junction, which is one of the country’s busiest and most dangerous motorway junctions. The final two weekend closures as part of the project will take place later this year. Between 4,000 and 6,000 vehicles normally use the M25 between Junctions 9 and 11 in each direction every hour from 10am until 9pm at weekends.     8.47am BST  FTSE 100 hits one-week high, European shares at one-month high  European shares are rising again, with the FTSE 100 index hitting a one-week high, as investors were cheered by a surprise fall in US inflation, boosting bets of an interest rate cut in September. The FTE 100 climbed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 8,255 this morning. The German Dax rose 0.25%, the French CAC edged nearly 0.2% higher and Italy’s FTSE MiB climbed by 0.5%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose as much as 0.3% to 521.41, the highest level since mid-June, led by gains in the telecoms sector.     8.29am BST  China exports grow at fastest rate in 15 months, as firms frontload orders ahead of tariffs  China’s exports grew at their fastest rate in 15 months in June, boosted by sales of cars, household electronics and semiconductors, while imports unexpectedly declined amid weak domestic demand. This suggests manufacturers are rushing through orders ahead of tariffs expected from a growing number of trade partners including the EU. There have been calls for further stimulus measures from the government as the $18.6 trillion economy struggles to get back on its fee. Exports grew by 8.6% year-on-year in June to $307.8bn and over the first half of 2024, China’s exports totalled $1.7tn, up by 3.6% year-on-year.  Auto exports rose by 18.9% in terms of value in the first half, and by 25.3% in volumes, amid lower export prices. Household electronics sales climbed by 14.8% in value terms, but showed even faster volume growth of 24.9%. Semiconductor exports grew by 21.6% year-on-year in terms of value, and by 9.5% in terms of volume. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said:  While the growth level does not appear too high at first glance, this has been stronger than most market participants were expecting at the start of the year…  There still could be some frontloading effect before auto tariffs from the EU and US come into play, but tariffs could lead to a slowdown in auto exports towards the end of the year…  Strong semiconductor export growth shows that China’s self-sufficiency push in tech and its pivot towards hi-tech manufacturing is starting to pay some dividends. China has been a major player in both the export and import of semiconductors as it gears up for the AI race.   Exports to Vietnam, Malaysia and other Asian countries were strong, and to Latin America, especially Brazil. In contrast, shipments to key developed markets were lacklustre, with exports to the US (1.5%), EU (-2.6%), Japan (-6.3%) and Korea (-3.7%) all a drag on export growth.  On the import side, with sluggish domestic demand there were with sharp declines in soybean (-19.8%), vegetable oil (-34.1%), and grain (-16.4%) imports. The continued drag from the property market pulled down down steel (-7.0%) and timber (-5.1%) imports. As China’s domestic car industry produces more competitive products, its auto imports have also contracted sharply, falling by 13.9%, Song noted. The net impact of June’s data of higher exports and slower imports translated to a higher trade surplus of $99.1bn. China’s trade surplus in the first half of the year was $434.9bn, up from $400.7bn a year earlier. Song said:  Heading towards the second half of the year, incoming tariffs and moderating growth in other global economies could start to weigh on export growth, but a supportive base effect will likely keep year-on-year export levels in mid-high single digit growth for most months.  We expect a smaller boost to growth from net exports in the second half of the year, though if imports continue to disappoint this contribution to GDP growth may remain solid in the coming quarters.    Updated at 9.24am BST    8.07am BST  Oil prices rise but Brent headed for weekly dip  Oil prices are rising today after signs of easing inflationary pressures in the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer, although Brent crude, the global benchmark, is on track for a weekly decline. Brent crude futures rose by 51 cents, or 0.6%, to $85.91 a barrel. US West Texas intermediate crude futures climbed by 59 cents, or 0.7%, to $83.21 a barrel.  Both contracts also gained in the past two days, but Brent is poised for a drop of around 1% this week following four weekly gains. US crude stocks have declined. The US Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that inventories fell by 3.4m barrels to 445.1m barrels last week, which was more than analysts had expected. Yesterday, a bigger-than-expected drop in US inflation to 3% in June boosted expectations of interest rate cuts, which would help boost fuel consumption. Yeap Jung Rong, market strategist at IG, told Reuters:  Cooling US inflation numbers may support the case for the Fed to kickstart its policy easing process earlier rather than later, but it also adds to the series of downside surprises in US economic data, which points to a clear weakening of the US economy.      7.50am BST   Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the investment firm Capital.com, said:  The British pound has maintained its bullish bias since the UK election build-up. The fact that the election seemed so easy and straightforward has given investors a vote of confidence in UK assets, especially at a time when there is quite a bit of political instability worldwide. That’s not to say that the new Labour government will not face challenges up ahead, but for now, the political landscape seems a lot calmer than France. Sterling-dollar has also been taking advantage of a weaker US dollar. The pair has been building the gains day after day.      7.33am BST  Introduction: Pound hovers near one-year high; Japan's SoftBank buys UK chipmaker Graphcore  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The pound is hovering near a one-year high following yesterday’s stronger-than-expected GDP data, which showed the UK economy returned to growth in May with a 0.4% expansion. At the same time, US inflation came in lower than expected, falling to an annual rate of 3% in June from 3.3% in May, fuelling hopes of a September interest rate cut and driving the dollar lower. Sterling hit a peak of $1.2947 yesterday, the highest level since late July 2023, and is approaching the $1.30 mark. This morning, it is up by a smidgen to $1.2911. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said:  In the UK, the pound was already bid yesterday morning after stronger-than-expected growth data helped traders scale back the expectation of an August cut from 70% to a coin toss. Combined with rising hawkish voices at the Bank of England, waning political risks and softening US dollar, we could see cable make an attempt on the $1.30 level. But the fact that the BoE hawks cry louder doesn’t mean that the doves are not around…  Japan’s SoftBank has bought the British artificial intelligence chipmaker Graphcore for an undisclosed sum, ending long-running speculation over the company’s future. Once touted as a rival to US chipmaker Nvidia, which has seen its own valuation rocket thanks to booming demand for AI computer chips, Graphcore has struggled to secure the investment needed to compete. Graphcore was valued at $2.77bn at the end of 2020, but the company’s losses widened and it said last October that it needed more cash. It slashed its workforce by a fifth to 494 staff, and shut down operations in Norway, Japan, and South Korea.

      "Britain risks a tech “talent drain” to the US if British pension funds fail to back the sector, according to the co-founder of a UK chipmaker that has announced its sale to Japan’s SoftBank. Nigel Toon, the co-founder and chief executive of Graphcore, said domestic pension funds were giving inadequate support to private businesses in the UK. “They’re certainly not investing in private companies here in the UK,” he said. “How can we expect businesses to grow without those pools of capital unless they secure funding from other sources?” As well as British pension fund investors missing out on the benefits, said Toon, there was a risk that UK tech talent is lured away by foreign investors that have stepped in to provide growth funding. US-based venture capital firms could, for instance, require British startups to move across the Atlantic, the Graphcore boss said. “You naturally get this drain away of good talent from the UK if you’re not careful,” Toon said. “If there isn’t those pools of capital, if they don’t exist here, then the risk is that some of those young companies will be pulled away.” The Bristol-based startup’s products are focused on artificial intelligence, and Toon acknowledged Britain was “doing well” in AI but that was mainly driven by foreign investment from big US tech firms such as Microsoft, Meta and Google, which bought the UK-based DeepMind in 2014. Toon said the SoftBank deal would lead to a multibillion-pound investment in the UK. “This is probably going to end up bringing billions in investment in AI to the UK,” he said, adding that Graphcore would grow its 350-member workforce and build a “very substantial AI engineering effort”. Last year, Graphcore warned that there was a “material uncertainty” over its survival and that it needed fresh funding by May 2024. Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, alluded to Graphcore’s problems as he backed the deal, saying it was a “welcome end to the uncertainty that has faced Graphcore and its employees”. Graphcore is the latest UK tech company to be bought by SoftBank, which acquired the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm for £24bn in 2016. SoftBank remains the biggest shareholder in Arm after its listing in New York last year. It also recently led a $1bn (£774m) investment in the British self-driving technology startup Wayve. Toon said the demand for computing power to train and operate AI systems was vast and was continuing to grow. Graphcore makes chips called intelligence processing units, which can be used to train and operate AI models. Chips are a core piece of hardware behind AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, and demand for them has driven the valuation of Nvidia, the market leader, which makes a different type of chip called a GPU, to more than $3tn. “The opportunity here is not to replace Nvidia, which I think is a sort of poor analogy. It’s bringing choice for people and bringing different approaches that allow new types of AI to be developed,” he said, adding that the AI chip market could develop into “two or three” big players including Nvidia. “Can we be one of those other players sitting alongside Nvidia? Absolutely,” Toon said. SoftBank said products such as Graphcore’s would be vital as the tech industry pushed for artificial general intelligence – systems with human-level capabilities. “Next-generation semiconductors and compute systems are essential in the AGI journey. We’re pleased to collaborate with Graphcore in this mission,” said Vikas J Parekh, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. The Financial Times, citing two people familiar with the matter, put the value of the deal at $600m. Valued at $2.8bn at the end of 2020, a filing published last year revealed Graphcore needed more cash to break even, after cutting its headcount by a fifth and shutting operations in Norway, Japan and South Korea.  Graphcore will continue to be based in Bristol, with offices in Cambridge, London, Gdańsk in Poland and Hsinchu in Taiwan.\n",
      "For millions of UK employees the shift towards remote working triggered by the coronavirus lockdowns merely meant a better work-life balance, but for Emma*, an office administrator from the Midlands whose husband has a disability and relies on her for care, it was “a lifeline”. Even after Covid restrictions lifted in 2021 she continued to mostly work from home, until she was told last autumn “out of the blue” that she had to attend the office more, though she says no problems had been reported with her output and only “vague reasons” were given. “I said I couldn’t do it as care costs £35 an hour here, it was just unaffordable. They weren’t going to budge, so I had to resign.” Emma has since filed a legal claim for constructive dismissal and will be taking her case to an employment tribunal. She is among dozens of people – some employed by big British brands, others by smaller companies or in the public sector – who shared with the Guardian their difficulties with an employer’s push to reduce remote working. Respondents to an online callout said they had lodged internal grievances after they were asked to work from the office going forward, either full-time or part-time, with some saying they were taking legal action against their employer or considering doing so. Others said they had opted for voluntary redundancy over the issue, had quit their roles or were looking to leave soon, as some of their colleagues had already done. Some employees felt they had been treated unfairly and potentially illegally by their employers when they were asked to return to the office at short notice after lengthy periods of hybrid or remote working. Some said they were awaiting their employer’s decision on a flexible working request and would pursue an employment tribunal if it was not granted because they believed there were no reasonable grounds for a refusal. Such legal action over back-to-desk edicts is on the rise as increasing numbers of companies advocate a minimum number of days attending company premises or a five-day return. The chief executive of Boots, Seb James, who in March ordered staff back in for the full week, is one of many bosses who has suggested that remote workers miss out on the benefits of in-person interaction. A judge at an employment tribunal case brought earlier this year agreed that there were “weaknesses with remote working”, ruling against the request of a senior manager at the UK Financial Conduct Authority to work at home full-time. However, the vast majority of those who got in touch opposed blanket return-to-office directives, suggesting that they were arbitrary, or more about “having bums on seats” in costly office facilities. Many felt that arguments that working on-site was better for productivity were undermined by the fact that their open-plan offices or workplaces were loud and stressful or had a limited number of desks that had to be booked in advance. Jennie, an NHS administration worker from the north of England, said she quit her job this summer after she was threatened with disciplinary action if she did not start commuting hundreds of kilometres to the office with immediate effect, after years of working remotely from a different city. She has taken legal advice on pursuing an employment tribunal because she believes not enough notice was given. “I’m very determined to take this to court,” she said. “I loved my job. I want compensation, and my solicitor has told me I’ve got a case.” Staff at the Office for National Statistics are refusing to comply with an instruction to spend two days a week in offices and voted in April to go on strike over the issue, a case that was referenced by some who got in touch. Kate, a 28-year-old from the south of England, was one of several respondents who said they had been hired for fully remote positions during or even before the pandemic and were furious about having been asked unexpectedly or abruptly to come into to the office. Reasons for wanting to work remotely at least some of the time included caring responsibilities, school runs, health problems or expensive and time-consuming commutes. Like others, she said she had been hired during the pandemic and been “promised opportunities to progress”. However, her employer began making all promotions subject to a reapplication for an office-based position, which she said disproportionately affected female employees.  Laura, a corporate accountant from southern England, said she was one of several colleagues who had made flexible working requests this year after her employer, a large hospitality brand, had ordered all employees to be in the office at least four days a week. Remote working had meant that she could put in longer hours while being at home with her primary school-age children, as well as offering more flexibility connecting with overseas colleagues in different time zones. The company initially refused her request to have the option to work from home at least three days a week but after she appealed, she was given two days working from home. “There is no business reason which would negatively impact my employer [if I work from home]. They don’t look at us as individuals with personal needs and different roles.” Her employer’s primary argument for a return to the office, she said, had been “fairness”, because some staff were in roles that made it impossible to work from home. If her request had been refused, she added, she would have taken legal action. Howard, a management consultant in his 50s from London, disagreed with many other respondents’ views on remote working, arguing that it had led to considerable problems in the day-to-day operations at his workplace. It had hit younger staff, he said, who were struggling to learn on the job while isolated at home. “It takes much longer to find out information, or who to talk to,” he said. “Everyone wants to take their time and be at home, but I can see constantly that the things that need to be talked about are only talked about in an emergency.” A number of people with disabilities or health problems, as well as some single parents, said their need to work flexibly or remotely had been disregarded by “draconian” and “inflexible” company-wide orders, and that they were now merely granted short-term exceptions that were subject to frequent reviews. Charlie, an expert in workplace needs assessments who often advises clients who have a disability or are neurodivergent, agreed that it has been getting harder for such workers to get their employer to sign off on suitable arrangements. Widespread negative assumptions about home working, he said, had led many employers to issue sweeping back-to-the-office orders that were not in their own or their staff’s best interests, and potentially in breach of the Equality Act. “I think modern management is largely about conformity and compliance, but the people I work with have specific needs, many of which have legal protections. Employers are at risk of exposing themselves to quite serious legal issues, but it’s also bad for business. Productivity in this country has been flat for a long time, and this inflexibility is one of the reasons behind it.” The high cost of living was the most common reason given for opposing a full-time or near full-time return to the office. Working from home, respondents said, had allowed them to ditch cars, reduce childcare costs, save thousands on train commutes, petrol and parking costs, or even move to cheaper areas. Those trying to recruit staff to both the private and public sector said it had become much harder because their employers refused to allow remote working, which was turning off many applicants who were unwilling or unable to relocate to more expensive areas closer to the workplace. Janet, a head of post-production in the TV industry, said her employer has a strict “no remote working policy” these days. “I’ve lost out on some great candidates as they don’t want to pay London rental prices, nor the expensive travel costs, when the technology is there to support remote working,” she said.  “One of the upsides of the pandemic was that it really levelled out the world of work. Everyone worked remotely and it worked brilliantly. So many young people have left the industry now, because they couldn’t afford to come to work. It makes me really angry.” *All names have been changed for anonymity\n",
      "Thames Water was hit with penalties of nearly £39m last year after missing a string of environmental targets and said its tumultuous corporate governance had damaged its reputation. The debt-laden company – which was this week put into special measures by the regulator, Ofwat – missed 21 regulatory targets last financial year in multiple areas, from pollution incidents to leakage and supply interruptions, a report said. Thames, which serves 16 million customers across London and the Thames valley, was hit with a £12m penalty after coming bottom among 17 companies ranked for customer service. It said halting brand campaigns to focus on its turnaround had hit its scores, and “customer perception has also been influenced by negative media publicity this year, including the resignation of our CEO, company debt, operational issues, and pollution fines”. The penalties emerged in the company’s annual performance report, which was belatedly released late on Wednesday night. The document was published a day after Thames Water warned that it would run out of cash by next June without fresh funds, and the night before Ofwat put it into the unprecedented “turnaround oversight regime”. Britain’s biggest water supplier could be put into a government-handled administration and the bulk of its £15.2bn debt mountain added to the public purse if it cannot raise extra funds to invest in its ageing assets. Although the new penalties will put further strain on the company’s balance sheet, they are unlikely to play a significant part in deciding its future, as it aims to raise £3.25bn in fresh equity.  Ofwat was accused of treating customers with “contempt” as it said bill payers in England and Wales would have to pay an extra £94 on average over five years as water companies attempt to fix sewage spills and leaks which have angered politicians and campaigners. The regulator penalises and rewards English and Welsh water companies based on their performance against multiple targets over a year. Thames’s largest penalty was £16.3m for water supply interruptions, caused in part by an outage in Guildford – blamed on Storm Ciarán – which left thousands in Surrey without water last year. “The weather has once again exposed the fragility of our assets,” Thames said in its report. The company was hit with a £14m penalty for missing leakage targets, blamed in part on cold snaps in December and January; £12m for increasing pollution incidents; and £7m for poor performance in internal sewer flooding. Overall, the £38.6m in total net penalties was down on £82.3m the year before, but above the £35m in 2021-22. Thames received financial rewards for progress in renewable energy production and reducing sewer collapses.  Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, who joined the business in January, said its employees “remain focused on the delivery of our three-year turnaround plan”. The company hopes to avoid nationalisation by raising money in the private markets. In its report, the chair, Sir Adrian Montague, said: “With the right team, time, money and resources, Chris and I both believe we can turn this business around – it would be in the best interest of customers and the environment for Thames Water to remain market-led.” The new penalties come against the backdrop of a strained relationship between Ofwat and Thames. The regulator revealed on Thursday that members of the company’s board did not support elements of its own five-year business plan and called the costs “poorly justified”. Thames Water also said it had to halt a £70m “green economic recovery” (GER) programme, agreed during the pandemic. The programme was designed to accelerate the rollout of smart meters, and the allowance was contingent on the company hitting leakage targets. However, it blamed a drought and “freeze-thaw events” for missing the targets. Ofwat rejected a request to alter the targets. Thames said that decision meant “we were left with no alternative but to stop the GER programme”, and acknowledged that it would be a “disappointment” for customers. The Guardian revealed last year that Thames had failed to install a single smart meter in the Thames valley under the programme, which was supposed to deliver 204,700 of the devices.\n",
      "China posted a record $99bn (£76.4bn) trade surplus last month amid signs of importers bringing forward orders to beat higher tariffs on goods from the world’s second biggest economy. The latest official figures from Beijing showed exports growing at their fastest rate in 15 months, while the weakness of China’s domestic economy resulted in falling imports. The size of China’s trade surplus was far bigger than the $85bn expected by the financial markets and comes at a time of heightened concern in developed countries about Chinese exports.   Related: How will new EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles work?   Higher US tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and other hi-tech products come into force on 1 August, while higher EU import duties on Chinese electric vehicles came into force earlier this month. Analysts said the disparity between booming exports and sluggish imports highlighted the reliance of China’s economy on access to the west’s affluent consumers and would put pressure on Beijing to do more to stimulate domestic demand. “This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports,” said Zhiwei Zhang, the chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The sustainability of strong exports is a major risk for China’s economy in the second half of the year. The economy in the US is weakening. Trade conflicts are getting worse.” Exports grew by 8.6% year on year in June to $308bn (£238bn) and over the first half of 2024 China’s exports totalled $1.7tn, up by 3.6% year on year. Auto exports rose by 18.9% in terms of value in the first half of 2024 and by 25.3% in volume amid lower export prices. Lynn Song, the chief China economist at ING Bank, said there was likely to be a front-loading effect before auto tariffs from the EU and US came into effect, “but tariffs could lead to a slowdown in auto exports towards the end of the year”. Household electronics sales climbed by 14.8% in value terms but showed even faster volume growth of 24.9%. Semiconductor exports grew by 21.6% year on year in terms of value, and by 9.5% in terms of volume. “Strong semiconductor export growth shows that China’s self-sufficiency push in tech and its pivot towards hi-tech manufacturing is starting to pay some dividends,” Song said. Kelvin Lam, a China economist at Pantheon Macro, said there had been a pickup in Chinese exports to the US, the UK and Germany last month. “Export growth of hi-tech products, mechanical and electrical items, cars, and ships is outperforming those low value-added products that China thrived on in the 1990s.”\n",
      "Labour has summoned the bosses of some of the worst-performing train operators, including Avanti West Coast and TransPennine, for meetings next week as it seeks to rapidly reform the railways and reset industrial relations. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, will bring in Network Rail route directors to attend all talks with the train companies, signalling the move towards an integrated railway. After Haigh vowed to “move fast and fix things”, legislation to kickstart Great British Railways is expected to be announced in the king’s speech next week, and officials are beginning work to set up the new structure before the summer parliamentary recess.   Related: Royal Mail to stop using its own freight trains after almost 200 years   Haigh has already met rail union leaders at the Department for Transport as the new government looks to facilitate an end to the long-running rail dispute. Haigh said her meetings with Mick Whelan and Mick Lynch, the general secretaries of Aslef and the RMT respectively, were a departure from “the days of antagonism and gimmicks” and the start of “an era of grownup industrial relations”. Avanti and TransPennine Express are the first of a number of failing operators expected to meet the transport secretary in the coming week, with Labour warning it will be making a clear break with the previous government, which it claimed “failed passengers”. It is understood that the party is seeking legal advice over when performance constitutes a contractual breach sufficient to swiftly terminate contracts. The government will otherwise bring train services into public ownership under GBR as contracts expire. Haigh has long criticised Avanti in particular, accusing it during the election campaign of providing a “woeful service” – and this week several newly elected MPs immediately experienced cancellations and disruptions on their journeys on the intercity line from the north to parliament in London. Figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, show Avanti had the third worst reliability of all operators in Great Britain in the 12 months to the end of March, cancelling almost 7% of trains. It was twice given short-term extensions to its contract under the Conservatives with warnings to improve, before being awarded a long-term contract in late 2023. Improved industrial relations and an end to the wider rail dispute may help Avanti, which has partly suffered from drivers unwilling to work overtime and occasional high rates of staff absence. Aslef has said “anything is possible” in terms of a resolution to its long standoff over pay and conditions. Whelan said the previous government was an “obstructive puppet master” above the train companies and hoped Labour would allow them to deal freely, without imposing preconditions.\n",
      "The warning is to “wait for the snap, crackle and pop” as three glowing electrodes are dropped into an electric arc furnace in Cardiff. What follows sounds like thunder and lightning. It is a human-induced storm in a massive, ceramic-lined cup, holding 140 tonnes of rapidly melting steel. The plant, owned by Spain’s Celsa, melts scrap steel using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn the metal to liquid. The glowing steel is then ready to be cast, twisted and crushed into the rods used to reinforce concrete. The plant’s million tonnes of annual output have been used in projects ranging from buildings such as the Wembley Stadium and Shard, to infrastructure projects including the Elizabeth tube line and Hinkley Point nuclear power station. The electric arc furnace is a sign of the future for the rest of the UK industry. Tata Steel, based in Port Talbot, and British Steel, at Scunthorpe, are each planning to switch from polluting blast furnaces to the much greener electric technology. The plans will cut emissions, but also involve thousands of jobs losses, including 2,800 in south Wales. Pushing for investment The new Labour government has promised to renegotiate a £500m subsidy, agreed under the Conservatives, for Indian-owned Tata Steel to make the switch and so cut out nearly 2% of the UK’s carbon emissions. Tata tapped the last iron from one blast furnace hours after voters gave Labour a landslide victory at the general election this month, and plans to close its second furnace in September. However, the UK’s newly installed business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has offered more money in the hope of saving jobs. Labour has pledged another £2.5bn investment in the UK steel industry. A large chunk is expected to go to Tata Steel on top of the £500m already agreed. Yet there have long been questions over how that cash will be spent, with Tata Steel insistent that it will not turn back from its decision to close the blast furnace. The picture is gradually becoming clearer, as Labour and the steelworker unions converge on a plan that aims to secure new investments which they hope will preserve hundreds of steel jobs in south Wales. The government is unlikely to offer to subsidise the polluting blast furnaces, which are losing £1m a day, according to Tata. But it is understood that fresh investments could include a new plate mill at Port Talbot to make shafts for wind turbines, and a new facility making the valuable galvanised steels used in cars and construction. An industry source said those functions could together provide 500 jobs.  Interactive  Gareth Stace, the chief executive of UK Steel, a lobby group, said he believed there was a “significant future opportunity within offshore wind for the steel sector in the UK” that would be ripe for investment. “We want to be able to supply that steel,” he said. “In order to achieve that we do need investment.” It is understood that the government and unions are unlikely to push for Tata Steel to invest in using hydrogen to produce lower-carbon steel. So-called “direct reduced iron” (DRI) has long been mooted as an option to decarbonise the UK steel industry, but an industry source said DRI appeared to be a non-starter. Three people with knowledge of the talks said there was a weak business case for Tata to build a DRI plant, because it would source most of its raw materials from scrap metal. Another big issue is the complete absence of industrial scale “green” hydrogen made with renewable electricity in the UK. Reynolds this week also raised questions about “the size of the new furnaces that might be put in place” at Port Talbot. Tata is committed to building an electric arc furnace capable of producing 3.2m tonnes of metal a year, and wants to order the machinery by September. Unions are understood to be pushing for discussions on building a second, smaller, electric arc furnace, potentially in Llanwern. However, a source close to Tata suggested the company did not see enough demand to support this. Talks halted on 22 May after another union, Unite, threatened industrial action. However, they restarted after that threat was lifted. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, another union representing steelworkers, said Reynolds was briefed on a draft memorandum of understanding drawn up between Tata and the unions that discussed possible options. Rickhuss said the business secretary had “acknowledged the investment commitments already secured, and indicated these would form the basis of ongoing negotiations with Tata Steel”. But time was running short, he said. “We call on Tata to engage urgently in meaningful discussions with the government to unlock greater investment and protect jobs.” A Tata Steel spokesperson pointed to previous comments, including by the company’s global chief executive, Thachat Viswanath Narendran, that it was open to further investments but would need a convincing business case to proceed. From coal to electricity Whatever happens it appears that British blast furnaces are on their way out (although Chinese-owned British Steel has yet to make a formal decision on when to close its two furnaces in Scunthorpe). Blast furnaces evolved over the course of hundreds of years of steelmaking, but the basic method is similar to the one pioneered in Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The furnace uses coal combustion to strip oxygen out of iron ore. The resulting molten iron is then processed to produce steel. However, much of the oxygen combines with the carbon in coal to produce carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to global heating. Electric arc furnaces do not require coal. Tata’s plan is to switch from transforming iron ore into metal, and instead take scrap steel from demolished bridges, buildings, cars – anything usable – and melt it down again using electricity. The circular process promises huge carbon savings compared with blast furnaces. Celsa, which employs 1,800 people in the UK, took over the Cardiff site, formerly known as Allied Steel and Wire, in 2002. It installed the electric arc furnace in 2006. The flames shooting to the ceiling of the Cardiff arc furnace are a clear sign that the process is not carbon-free. However, Celsa said emissions associated with its steel were 88% less than those from a blast furnace. It has committed to be carbon neutral by 2050 and says it will achieve that by using fully renewable electricity, though will have to rely on carbon offsets until it can use hydrogen and other technologies for functions beyond the arc furnace. Sovereign security The shift to electric arc furnaces does not address another issue highlighted by Labour and by some in the defence industry: if the blast furnaces at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe are closed, the UK will be left without a way of transforming iron ore into steel. Chris McDonald, a former Tata Steel engineer, is one of the advocates for Britain investing in a hydrogen DRI facility for the “sovereign security” of being able to make steel. In 2014 McDonald went from Tata’s old research division to the not-for-profit Materials Processing Institute, before being elected last week as Labour’s MP for Stockton North, where he will try to influence the new government. The UK steel sector would probably only need one DRI plant, given the volume of scrap it has, said McDonald. However, it is unclear which individual company would step up to invest. McDonald suggested a plant could be built as a joint venture backed by government. If the blast furnace closures proceed, the UK will be left as the only G20 country without the ability to make its own steel, just as the chaos of global supply chains has come to the fore with the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I think the onus is on us to explain why we know better than the other 19,” said McDonald. “We want to be able to be sure we can make steel whatever happens in the world.”\n",
      "Major supermarkets and business owners across the country are giving staff members a lie-in on Monday to recover from the drama of watching England play Spain in the final of the Euros. The game starts at 8pm and could last until 11pm if it goes to penalties. In preparation, some companies are offering workers early finishes if they are due to be on shift on the evening of the game, while others are telling employees they can come in late on Monday. The supermarket chain Lidl, a sponsor of the tournament, said it would open all its stores in England an hour later on Monday so workers could enjoy some post-match celebrations.   Related: Starmer raises hopes of extra bank holiday if England win Euros   Ryan McDonnell, the chief executive of Lidl in Great Britain, said: “We know how much this game means to England fans and we want to ensure that our colleagues have the chance to celebrate such a significant moment in English football history.” Tesco said it would close its more than 1,800 Express stores at 7.30pm instead of the usual 10 or 11pm on Sunday to allow employees to watch the final. It promised to allow thousands of staff to get home or to the pub in time for kick-off while still receiving their normal pay for those hours.  Sainsbury’s is also closing convenience stores and petrol filling stations across England early. It’s not just retailers planning a late start: the drinks brand Dash Water said employees could start work at a later time of 10.30am on Monday so they could enjoy the game without having to worry about waking up early. The marketing agency FlamePR is closing its office in London on Monday and allowing staff to work from home. If England win, they will also be allowed to start later. The creative PR agency PrettyGreen is offering all staff a free large pizza delivery at any point over the weekend and a lie-in until 11am on Monday. Woodlands primary school in Hertfordshire posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it knew that “a number of children will be watching the match and going to bed late” on Sunday and it would leave registrations open until the later time of 9.25am on Monday.

You could say come in whenever you want … or say when you do come in let’s celebrate.” \n",
      "Politicians and campaigners have condemned proposed water bill rises for England and Wales, accusing the industry regulator of showing “contempt” to customers who have endured poor service, sewage dumping and leaks. Ofwat’s recommendation on Thursday that households pay on average £94 more over five years to fund improvements in environmental standards was described as a “bitter pill” by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The regulator also put struggling Thames Water into unprecedented special measures, allowing extra scrutiny of Britain’s biggest supplier, as fears grow over whether it may have to go through a painful restructuring or be temporarily nationalised. The UK’s private water companies have faced a barrage of public anger, after years of taking out millions in bonuses and dividends while underinvesting in an ageing network led to high levels of leaks and sewage overflows. In March, data revealed that untreated human waste was discharged for more than 3.6m hours into rivers and seas last year, up 105% on the previous 12 months. Ofwat’s plans to pay for the necessary repairs by raising household bills were met with anger by activists and politicians. The former Undertones singer turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey accused the watchdog of charging customers twice by “allowing water companies to put up bills by a large amount to pay for infrastructure they should have already paid for”. Keir Starmer said the Conservatives had let the water industry “get completely out of hand”, and Labour would look at “possible further regulation” to tackle pollution and rising bills.  Interactive  On Thursday, water bosses met the environment secretary, Steve Reed, to promise to fix sewage leaks and serve customers better. Ofwat’s review, its first assessment of English and Welsh water companies’ spending plans for 2025-30, ruled they could spend £88bn over the five-year period, which would be recovered from bills. The figure is £16bn lower than companies had proposed but still raised concerns that consumers were paying the price for previous underinvestment by water companies, which have paid out £78bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated £60bn in debt. Sharkey added: “I am now so outraged with the contempt Ofwat is showing to customers that we should be taking to the streets outside parliament to show that we will no longer take their greed, their incompetence and their complete and utter disregard for customers and the environment.” The price review was seen as critical for debt-laden Thames Water. Ofwat took the unprecedented step of putting the company into a “turnaround oversight regime”, subjecting it to extra scrutiny and forcing it to regularly report on the progress of moves to reduce sewage spills by 64%, cut leaks by 19% and slash supply interruptions by 66%. The review is seen as unlikely to have improved investor sentiment towards the company, which could be put into a government-handled administration if it fails to raise fresh funds. Such a collapse could mean Thames’s £15.2bn of debts being added to the public purse. Water company executives signed up to a set of reforms after meeting Reed on Thursday. The new measures ensure funding for vital infrastructure is ringfenced for upgrades that benefit consumers and the environment, and is refunded if it is not spent. Companies have also pledged to make the interests of customers and the environment their “primary objective”, and that households and businesses will see compensation for water supply outages double. Consumers will also receive payments if suppliers issue “boil water notices”, as occurred this year when a parasite caused a spate of illness in Devon. Reed said: “The new government will force water companies to tackle illegal sewage dumping into our rivers, lakes and seas. Firm action should have been taken much earlier to ensure money was spent on fixing the sewage system, not siphoned off for bonuses and dividends.” Starmer said Labour was devising a plan to “get to grips” with the governance of water. He said this would not involve nationalising the entire industry, which some campaigners have called for. It would, however, potentially involve more regulation and “something I’m very keen on, which is to have sort of personal responsibility from the top”. The Liberal Democrats called for “insulting price hikes by water companies” to be blocked. Their environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost of living crisis, all while dumping raw sewage into our rivers.” The Environment Agency has previously said water company bosses ought to be jailed for serious pollution. Ofwat belatedly brought in powers to block executive bonuses if a company has committed serious criminal breaches. The water bill rises are expected to pile further pressure on households struggling with the cost of living crisis. Mike Keil, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: “Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them, given some water companies’ track record of failure and poor service.” Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s now glaringly obvious that these water firms will continue to demand dividends and bonuses for continuing to not do their job for as long as they are allowed to do so. The regulator can’t solve this without full government backing for a more interventionist approach.” The Green MP Siân Berry, the party’s former leader, called for the water companies to be nationalised, saying this would allow government to “invest affordably in the creaking infrastructure without all the harm falling on to our bills”. Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said: “Let me be very clear to water companies. We will be closely scrutinising the delivery of their plans and will hold them to account to deliver real improvements to the environment and for customers.” Water UK, which represents water companies, reacted angrily to the limits in the planned spending. A spokesperson said: “Today’s announcement is the biggest ever cut in investment by Ofwat. If it doesn’t put this right, Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past.” The body argued that new housing would be blocked, improvements in river water quality would be slowed and water shortages would become more likely if companies were not allowed to spend the more than £100bn they had proposed. Despite this, shares in the listed water companies rose on Thursday, with South West Water’s owner, Pennon, up 11%, indicating investors believe Ofwat’s verdict was positive for the industry. The biggest bill increases Ofwat allowed were for Southern Water, with a £183 rise to £603; Dŵr Cymru in Wales, which will increase bills by £137 to £603, and Hafren Dyfrdwy, whose bills will be rising by £128 to £524. Ofwat said companies would invest £10bn to tackle storm overflows, with a target to reduce spills by 44% from levels in 2021. A string of new environmental targets will be introduced, including tasking companies in England to limit spills to 16 incidents a year by 2029.\n",
      "The Labour government is grappling with a legal dilemma over its plan to impose an immediate ban on new North Sea oil and gas exploration before the industry’s latest licensing round closes. The party swept to power last week with the pledge to end new North Sea exploration licences but its plans have been cast into doubt by the timing of an ongoing licensing round. The new government will need to decide whether or not to cancel the process, which could end up granting a small number of new North Sea licences in breach of its pledge to end new oil and gas exploration. But cancelling the mechanism, which is run by the industry regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), could leave the new government vulnerable to a volley of legal actions from the companies, which may have spent millions preparing their bids. The government is expected to take legal advice on how to implement its North Sea policy, without risking a legal challenge from oil and gas companies, before taking a final decision on the live licensing round. Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against fossil fuels, said it would be “shocking” if a newly elected government failed to deliver on a manifesto pledge to stop North Sea development. “People in this country voted for change, not more of the same rip-off energy system where oil and gas companies walk off with massive profits and we’re all left with higher bills, declining jobs and a worsening climate crisis,” she said. “Finally, we have a government that is prepared to move the UK to a better, fairer energy system,.” Ministers are also under pressure from trade unions to safeguard millions of jobs that rely on the North Sea industry while they switch to greener sectors. The Labour party manifesto said it would “ensure a phased and responsible” transition away from drilling in the North Sea that would recognise “the proud history of our offshore industry and the brilliance of its workforce”. Labour’s pledge to end new North Sea drilling was central to its promise to turn Britain into a clean energy superpower. The party promised to rule out new oil and gas while doubling onshore wind, tripling solar power and quadrupling the UK’s offshore wind power capacity.  A government spokesperson said: “As previously stated, we will not issue new licences to explore new fields. We will also not revoke existing oil and gas licences and will manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan.” The government was forced to deny reports that the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had defied his own officials by ordering an immediate ban on new licences, including those still being considered by the regulator. The spokesperson said the report, published in the Daily Telegraph, was a “complete fabrication” which “invents meetings and decisions that have not taken place”. “We are working with the North Sea Transition Authority to ensure a fair and balanced transition in the North Sea,” the spokesperson added. The latest licensing round, which launched in the autumn of 2023, involved 76 oil and gas companies submitting 115 bids to carry out exploration work across 257 “blocks” of the North Sea, Irish Sea and east Atlantic. However, bids for a small number of fields were still awaiting a decision from the NSTA when Rishi Sunak called the snap election in May. In the same month the NSTA said: “Further consideration is being given to a small number of remaining applications and a few more may be offered at a later date.” A spokesperson for the NSTA declined to comment on the regulator’s previous statement. He said: “We follow the policy direction set by the government of the day.”\n",
      "How bad are things at Thames Water? So bad that Ofwat has invented a new tool – a “turnaround oversight regime” – to get a grip on the financial and operational mess. The regulator’s manoeuvre is clearly justified. The water company, under its umpteenth new chief executive, has just filed (late) a business plan judged “inadequate”. Its board could not provide formal assurance that statutory obligations on environment performance would be met. And remember, Thames has already been abandoned, in effect, by owners who think the firm is “uninvestable”. So, yes, heightened regulatory scrutiny looks like a minimum requirement until a workable solution is found. But the intriguing part was Ofwat’s thinking on how Thames might eventually emerge from special measures. The company will need to show it can maintain “adequate levels of financial resilience”. This could involve “introducing a limit on the amount of debt the company can take on, a separation of the business into two or more water companies, or looking to a public listing to secure additional equity”. The last of those – a return to the stock market – is the one to focus on. If Ofwat has finally concluded that a privatised water system in England and Wales works better if the companies are listed on the London stock market, give thanks. This column has been banging on (repeatedly) about the virtues of a listing. Why? First, stock market investors would never have tolerated the extreme over-leverage that was imposed on Thames after Macquarie bought the company in 2006. You cannot get away with 80%-plus gearing in the public arena. The three firms that still remain on the market – Severn Trent, United Utilities (in the north-west) and Pennon (owner of South West Water) – have never strayed far from regulatory norms of 60%-ish. Second, financial transparency improves on the stock market. You don’t have holding companies in the Cayman Islands, or tax-minimising financing vehicles inserted above the regulated entity. Third, a share price and a six-monthly public reporting cycle provides a warning signal of trouble ahead. Incompetent and failing managements tend to be cleared out earlier. Fourth, a public listing ensures closer proximity to the public: the customers can buy shares if they wish. In the post-Macquarie era, Thames’s ownership consortium has included giant sovereign funds from Abu Dhabi and China, for whom a UK water company is a faraway entry on a spreadsheet. A path back to the stock market for Thames looks far from simple, it should be said. Step one would surely have to involve a debt-for-equity swap to clear the decks and reduce the towering £15.2bn pile of borrowings. The process could happen either voluntarily or be enforced via special administration – one or the other has probably become more likely after Thursday. Nobody should mourn for Thames’s bondholders, who would take a whack in a financial reconstruction: they have also contributed to the soggy disaster. By way of further demonstration of the relative merits of stock market ownership, look at how the quoted firms emerged from Ofwat’s five-yearly review. The business plans of Severn Trent and Pennon were the only two in the sector to be judged “outstanding” and United Utilities got a middle-of-the-pack “standard”. Nobody is pretending the trio is faultless. All have had pollution and leakage woes (United notably at Windermere; Pennon with a diarrhoea and vomiting outbreak in Devon) And some of the executive bonuses are inexplicable (think Liv Garfield at Severn). Stock market ownership is not a cure-all. The point, though, is that the evidence of a couple of decades suggest it is easier to get listed companies to respond to regulatory incentives than unlisted ones. In a privatised system designed to reward relative outperformers, and penalise underperformers, that is an important point. Indeed, there is a fair argument that regulators only truly lost control of the whole privatised show after the take-private leveraged buyout boom of 2004-08. The new Labour government should take note. It is dead set against nationalising water companies – and rightly so. But it would perform a service if it could force more firms back to the stock market.\n",
      "The water industry regulator has put Thames Water into unprecedented special measures, allowing extra scrutiny of the struggling water supplier as it faces the prospect of a painful restructuring or temporary nationalisation. Ofwat said on Thursday that the company, which is creaking under £15.2bn of debt, would be placed in a “turnaround oversight regime” and subjected to “heightened regulatory” measures, meaning it must regularly report on the progress of its investment plan. It is the first time a water company has faced such measures and comes amid increased fears the supplier will collapse into a publicly funded administration. The regulator made the announcement as it published its draft review on English and Welsh water companies’ business proposals, which found the Thames plan to be “unsatisfactory”. Ofwat said customers at Britain’s biggest water company, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, would face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years, a £99 rise to £535. Thames had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years. Overall, the review suggested the average water bill across the companies could rise by 21%, or £94, over the next five years, also to £535. Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said of the Thames business plan: “Costs were poorly justified, service levels were unsatisfactory and so that makes our job more challenging.” He said the response to Thames had been “fair” and that it was “up to Thames to convince investors” of its turnaround as it attempts to raise fresh funds. The supplier’s plan was “late” and “incomplete”, said an Ofwat board member, Chris Walters. “Overall, it lacked ambition. Parts of it certainly did not have the assurance of Thames’s own board, and it’s difficult for us to stand behind a plan that a board won’t stand behind.” Thames investors said in March that Ofwat had made the company “uninvestable” as they U-turned on £500m of pledged funding. The company said this week it would approach potential investors this autumn, before the regulator’s final verdict in December. It said this week it had enough cash to fund its operations until next June. However, if it is unsuccessful in raising new funds it could fall into special administration, with the company temporarily nationalised and the bulk of its debts transferred to the state. The Ofwat price review is viewed as crucial in giving certainty over future revenues and returns, but the restrictions on bill increases are unlikely to have boosted Thames’s attractiveness to investors. Anthony Legg, a water industry expert at PA Consulting, said: “It is difficult to see how these measures restore investor confidence or at the same time allow the management team the space to deliver on its turnaround plan. “The possibility of a special administration regime, despite government reluctance, appears to have increased, though this could still be avoided.”  Interactive  Thames had submitted a revised business plan increasing its proposed spending from £18.7bn to £19.8bn. Ofwat said on Thursday the company would only be allowed to spend £16.9bn. Within that sum, more than £3.3bn is contingent on Thames proving it is “ready and able” to make certain investments. Over the next five years, it has been tasked with reducing sewage spills by 64%, cutting leaks by 19% and reducing supply interruptions by two-thirds. As a result of being put into special measures, Thames will have to provide a delivery action plan and regularly report on the progress of its spending programme. It will also have to provide a financial resilience plan and could be scrutinised by an independent monitor, who would be given full access to company information. In order to exit the regime, it will need to show an improvement in its operating performance, delivery of investments and the state of its balance sheet. The company could be limited in the amount of debt it can take on. Ofwat said it had suggested that, in a longer-term scenario, Thames could separate into two or more companies or list on the stock exchange to secure extra equity. A spokesperson for Thames Water said: “Ofwat has asked us to look again at our turnaround plan, and is seeking enhanced oversight of our delivery against it. We are in any case taking stock of our turnaround plan under our new leadership and reflecting on our progress to date. “We will consider all of Ofwat’s proposals as we go through this process. This is one stage in a longer process.” Ofwat said it was asking “further questions” about a dividend payment of more than £150m, first revealed by the Guardian. Thames has said the dividend did not reach external shareholders. Black said: “We will want to get further confidence that that is the nature of those payments and whether customers’ interests have been protected.”\n",

Headline prices fell by 0.1%m/m and core prices increased just 0.1%m/m, both comfortably below expectations. Indeed, this was the weakest monthly core inflation reading in more than three years and suggests the central bank is back on track with regards to hitting its inflation target. The news was pretty good across the board. Core goods prices were down again, helped by lower autos prices, with deflation in this sector having clearly resumed following a brief halt earlier this year. Otherwise, core services prices were up just 0.1%m/m, helped by much weaker shelter inflation. We of course have been waiting for the moderation in market rents to feed into these official measures and this is a tantalising signal that this might be more definitively playing out. Other services inflation meanwhile was negative for a second consecutive month, with air fares providing another huge contribution to this weakness. The bump in Q1 inflation is increasingly looking like a blip and the Fed should be increasingly confident that it can start to cut rates. This easing looks increasingly timely as activity and labor market indicators start to slow. Indeed, amid softer price pressures the Fed is likely to start to turn its attention to ensuring that this slide does not turn into a rout.”      2.34pm BST   Separate US figures showed the number of new jobless claims dipped by 17,000 to 222,000 and continuing claims held stable.

September rate cut chances are rising and so too is our belief that the Fed will cut rates three times this year rather than by just the two cuts priced by markets… We are finally seeing housing inflation slow with shelter coming in at 0.2% month on month rather than the 0.4% rate it has been trending at. Owners’ equivalent rent and primary rent were 0.3% MoM, the lowest for three years, while hotel prices fell sharply… Between now and then [September] we expect to see more evidence of a cooling jobs market and decelerating consumer spending growth. With the Fed keen to avoid a recession and achieve the targeted “soft landing” we think the Jackson Hole Conference at the end of August will be the venue for the Fed to signal more explicitly that interest rate cuts are coming.

As much as today was a referendum about the water industry’s future, it’s a decision about Ofwat’s future - that’s because it doesn’t have one, as yet again it has demonstrated it has no empathy whatosever for the rage and anger that persists across the nation and they simply continue to treat the environment and customers with utter contempt. They are allowing water companies to put up bills by a large amount to pay for infrastructure they should have already paid for with customer bills. Customers are therefore having to pay twice.  Sharkey said he is planning to march on parliament in disgust.  I am now so outraged with the contempt Ofwat is showing to customers that we should be taking to the streets outside parliament to show that we will no longer take their greed, their incompetence and their complete and utter disregard for customers and the environment.

Giles Bristow, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said:  The general election campaign made clear that the public is fed up with those in power turning a blind eye to the sewage scandal. Unfortunately today’s announcement, in which Ofwat accepts that we will all have to swim and surf in sewage way beyond 2030, does nothing to change that. Signing off on the continuation of at least 200,000 sewage discharges a year is simply unacceptable and a sign that the regulator still doesn’t comprehend the scale of public fury on this issue.  He called for the new Labour government to launch a public inquiry as the only way to “help us understand how we got here and how we can dig our way out”. Paul de Zylva, from Friends of the Earth, said the decision on bills and investment “yet again proves that our current form of water privatisation is not fit for purpose”.  It sees water companies pile pressure on Ofwat to allow them to hike customers’ bills to subsidise long-overdue investment in our crumbling sewage infrastructure which might cut or prevent some, but by no means all, pollution.”  While he said Ofwat’s draft determination shows it is not pandering to everything water companies want, many will still see the increase in bills as “unfair”. He called on the government to provide greater funding for the Environment Agency, which is tasked with regulating the environmental actions of water companies, and put a “green duty” on Ofwat alongside its environmental focus, as well as impose tougher sanctions on “irresponsible” water firms.  Updated at 11.00am BST    10.41am BST  Thames Water 'taking stock of turnaround plan'  Here is Thames Water’s response to today’s Ofwat announcement. Britain’s biggest water company said it had put forward an “ambitious plan” to Ofwat, asking for £19.8bn of total expenditure to maintain reliable supplies of safe drinking water and to deal with wastewater across London, the Thames Valley and Home Counties.  Within this we put forward record investment to improve infrastructure, meet new environmental standards and reduce river pollution. Our plan will also improve the resilience of our critical infrastructure in the face of challenges such as climate change and population growth. We believe our plan is ambitious, deliverable, financeable and investible. It is also underpinned by a package to support over 500,000 customers with reduced bills. Ofwat’s draft determination understandably challenges us on efficiency and delivery. They have been thoughtful in considering the funding we need for our day to day running costs and the improvements our customers and communities want to see. Although Ofwat currently categorises our business plan as ‘inadequate,’ this judgment rests on over 20 very specific tests around the scope of information to be provided, and evidence required to depart from Ofwat’s own assumptions. Ofwat has made clear it will revisit its view if we provide further evidence to reach a final determination that is, in the round, affordable for customers, deliverable, financeable, as well as investable. We welcome the opportunity to provide Ofwat with further evidence about the need for the investment we plan to make, our costs and how we will deliver it.  It said it was “taking stock of our turnaround plan under our new leadership”. Chris Weston, a former British Gas executive, was appointed as its new boss in December, replacing Sarah Bentley, and started in January. Thames said it will respond to Ofwat by 28 August, and the regulator will make a final determination in December.  Updated at 10.45am BST    10.28am BST  Pound hits four-month high after GDP data; European shares rise ahead of US inflation  The pound hit a four-month high after the better-than-expected UK GDP figures, which showed the economy grew by 0.4% in May following zero growth in April. Economists say this suggests that in the second quarter it grew at a similar rate to the first quarter’s 0.7%. Sterling rose by 0.2% to $1.2879.  European shares are rising ahead of the US inflation figures for June, out at lunchtime. The FTSE 100 index is 31 points, or 0.4%, higher at 8,224, with water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities leading the gains, up 3.2% and 2.6% respectively. The German and Italian markets edged 0.16% higher while the French index climbed by 0.5%. Headline inflation in the US is expected to have eased to 3.1% in June from 3.3% in May, while core inflation, which strips out energy and food, is forecast to have stayed at 3.4%. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, inflation eased to 2.5% in June from 2.8% in May, according to final official figures, leaving the door open for an interest rate cut from the European Central Bank in September. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said:  The new government has placed economic growth at the heart of its policies and it will be pleased to have inherited positive momentum with GDP. The bigger issue is whether the Bank of England will look at this data and feel less inclined to cut rates. After all, cutting rates is something a central bank does to stimulate a lacklustre economy, not grease the wheels for one already moving ahead. That said, momentum could easily lose pace, particularly if the jobs market weakens and sticky inflation causes consumers to stay cautious on spending. A stronger pound has traditionally been unfavourable for the FTSE 100 given many of its constituents earn in US dollars. That factor was given a backseat as utilities, miners and big consumer brand companies including Diageo and Unilever helped to push the index higher.      9.30am BST  Thames Water put into special measures  The water industry regulator has put Thames Water into special measures giving it extra scrutiny of the struggling water supplier, as it faces the prospect of a painful restructuring or temporary nationalisation. Ofwat said today that Thames, Britain’s biggest water company, would be placed in a “turnaround oversight regime” and subject to “heightened regulatory” measures, meaning the company must regularly report on the progress of its investment plan. The regulator made the announcement as it published its draft review on English and Welsh water companies’ business plans which showed bills will rise by £94 on average in England and Wales over the next five years. The plans proposed sums which companies intend to charge customers between 2025 and 2030. The review said Thames customers will face a 22% increase in their bills over the next five years. Ofwat said Thames would be allowed to increase bills by £99 to £535, £92 less than the company had proposed. Thames, which serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, had asked the regulator to raise bills by 44% over the next five years. The price review is seen as crucial for the future of Thames Water, which is creaking under £15.2bn of debt. The company said this week that, after the review, it would approach potential investors this autumn, before Ofwat’s final verdict in December. Over the next five years, Thames has been tasked with reduce sewage spills by 64%, cutting leaks by 19% and reducing supply interruptions by two-thirds. The regulator said:  Thames Water faces significant issues and as it seeks to tackle them, our draft determinations will support a major investment programme but also subject the company to new, heightened regulatory measures.  As a result of being put into the regime, Thames will have to provide a “delivery action plan” and regularly report on the progress of its spending programme.  Updated at 9.33am BST    9.10am BST  Water companies shares rise after Ofwat announcement  Shares in several water companies have risen and are leading gains on the FTSE 100 index this morning, following the Ofwat announcement that water bills in England and Wales will rise by an average of £94 over the next five years, in plans set out by the regulator. Severn Trent and United Utilities are the top two risers on the FTSE 100, up by 2.9% and 2.3% respectively. The index rose by 18 points, or 0.2%, overall to 82,12. Germany’s Dax rose by 0.3%, France’s CAC climbed by 0.5% and Italy’s FTSE MiB edged by 0.1% higher. FTSE 250-listed Pennon Group jumped 6.4% this morning. The Exeter-based utility said its finance chief Steve Buck was stepping down for personal reasons, after nearly a year in the role. He will be succeeded by Laura Flowerdew, a company insider and previously chief financial officer at Bristol Water.

He has written to Ofwat, asking the water regulator to ensure funding for vital infrastructure investment is ringfenced and can only be spent on upgrades benefiting customers and the environment. He also wants Ofwat to ensure that when money for investment is not spent, companies refund customers, with money never allowed to be diverted for bonuses, dividends or salary increases.  He wants water companies to change their Articles of Association, the rules governing each company, to make the interests of customers and the environment the primary objective.  Consumers will gain new powers to hold water company bosses to account through “powerful new customer panels,” the government said. For the first time in history, customers will have the power to summon board members and hold water executives to account.  Strengthened protection and compensation for households and businesses when their basic water services are affected. Subject to consultation, the amount of compensation customers are legally entitled to when key standards are not met will more than double. The payments will also be triggered by a wider set of circumstances including Boil Water Notices.  Reed said:  We will never look the other way while water companies pump sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas.  This unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, but change has now begun so it can never happen again.  Today I have announced significant steps to clean up the water industry to cut sewage pollution, protect customers and attract investment to upgrade its crumbling infrastructure. That change will take time. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline further steps to reform the water sector and restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.   Updated at 9.00am BST    8.36am BST  Water UK: Ofwat announcement 'biggest ever cut in investment'  Water UK, the trade body for the water industry, said the Ofwat announcement amounts to the “biggest ever cut in investment” in water and sewage infrastructure . A spokesperson said:  If it doesn’t put this right Ofwat will be repeating the mistakes of the past. As a direct result, more housing will be blocked, the recovery of our rivers will be slower and we will fail to deal with the water shortages we know are coming. Water companies proposed to invest £105bn because it is the minimum needed to meet the legitimate concerns we’ve heard from the public about our environment and our economy. Ofwat is right to want to ensure customers receive value for money and that is why protections are in place to ensure customers only pay for projects that are new, necessary and value for money. But for far too long, Ofwat has failed to be realistic about the levels of investment needed and what it will take to deliver and maintain necessary infrastructure. We cannot allow this pattern to repeat itself. Water companies are ready to invest in an unprecedented overhaul of the country’s water and sewage infrastructure. Ofwat now needs to let them get on with it.      8.25am BST   Meanwhile, Alan Lovell, chair of the Environment Agency, hailed Ofwat’s planned 21% average rise in water bills in England and Wales as a “significant step forward in delivering the investment needed to protect rivers and seas, boost water supplies and improve resilience to flooding”. Water companies have faced sustained criticism over leaky pipes, sewage dumping and extracted dividends in recent years. Lovell said:  It will deliver four times more investment in clean and plentiful water than the previous five-year period. The critical issue now is delivery. We will be playing our part to make sure the industry steps up on the environment. We are taking forward our biggest ever transformation in the way we regulate, recruiting up to 500 additional staff, increasing compliance checks and quadrupling the number of water company inspections by March next year. Our job is to make sure the water companies do what they say they will do, and people begin to see a difference in their water environment.  Bills will rise for customers of all water companies in England and Wales, apart from those of Wessex Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water. Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, a government-funded body, said:  Millions of people will feel upset and anxious at the prospect of these water bill rises and question the fairness of them given some water companies’ track record of failure and poor service.   Updated at 11.05am BST    8.18am BST  Ikley Clean River campaign says Ofwat has gone back on promises  Becky Malby of the Ilkley Clean River Group campaign in west Yorkshire, which wants to secure bathing water status for a river in England, said Ofwat had gone back on its promises.  A year ago, David Black, the CEO at Ofwat wrote to the Ilkey Clean River Group saying “We are firm in our commitment to ensuring that the customer should not pay twice for a company’s shortfall.” In addition he stated that “We are determined to use all the regulatory powers as fully as possible to improve the performance of water companies for customers and the environment.“ Today Ofwat announced a bill rise of £107 BEFORE inflation by 2029/30, for Yorkshire Water customers, amounting to an additional £9 per month + inflation. Our water system is at breaking point. The additional price increase secures a basic functioning sewage system here at Ilkley and is in direct contradiction to David Black’s promise. We are, after all, being told to pay twice.   Updated at 11.06am BST    8.14am BST   Construction output rebounded in May, today’s ONS figures showed. This week, the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled a number of measures aimed at getting “Britain building again”. Clive Docwra, managing director of property and construction consultancy McBains, said:  After previous statistics showed the construction sector lagging behind the modest uptick in growth witnessed in other industries, today’s figures are much better than expected. Especially welcome is that growth was experienced across most work sectors, with new housing seeing a 2.8% increase. Whether or not this represents the green shoots of recovery, however, is unclear. Over the three months to May output still decreased by 0.7%, showing that growth is still fragile. Despite these returns, the sector still needs a shot in the arm, and developers will hope Labour’s announcement this week to get the country building translates into renewed confidence from investors, both in housing and commercial projects. Every sector within the industry will also be crossing their fingers for a period of economic stability to help construction across the board get back on track.       8.08am BST   The UK economy springs back into life – it is faring much better so far in 2024 after a technical recession last year. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said:  The result is that overall second-quarter GDP is on track to rise by 0.5-0.6% after 0.7% growth in the first quarter. We’re sceptical that these sort of growth figures can be sustained into the second half of the year, but we expect growth to remain reasonable nevertheless. One important factor is that the impact of past rate hikes has largely taken its course now; we estimate that 80% of the mortgage squeeze is behind us. Does this change the story for the Bank of England? Probably not. Policymakers are still almost exclusively focused on services inflation, and it’s the one remaining release of this data that will determine whether the Bank can cut rates in August. Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill, perhaps unsurprisingly, refused to be drawn on what he thought in comments made yesterday. But barring any big surprises in those inflation numbers, we think the Bank’s preference will be to start cutting rates and we expect three cuts in total this year.   Updated at 8.30am BST    8.06am BST  Q2 growth likely to be close to Q1 strong expansion – economists  Another upside surprise for UK GDP in May means that second-quarter growth is likely to be close to the first quarter’s strong expansion, despite drags from the early Easter and strikes in the health sector. “The recovery has clearly built some strong momentum in the first half,” said the EY Item Club, which uses the Treasury’s forecasting model. It expects GDP to continue to grow at a decent pace in the second half, with consumers central to the story. Further solid gains in household spending power look likely, and if consumers adopt a less cautious approach, in line with recent household survey results, we can expect a strong pickup in consumer spending growth. Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, said:  Four days of strike action in the healthcare sector at the end of June will have weighed on output last month. But even allowing for that factor, GDP is likely to have grown by at least 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. Indeed, there’s a realistic possibility that Q2 could have matched the 0.7% growth achieved in Q1, so it’s clear that the recovery has built some strong momentum. The EY ITEM Club’s expectation that GDP continues to grow at a decent pace in H2 is founded mostly on optimism about consumer prospects. Lower inflation and still strong pay growth should combine to deliver further solid improvements in household spending power. Thus far, strong real income growth has only translated into a tepid recovery in spending as consumers have remained cautious. But there are signs from consumer surveys that the mood is changing, and the EY Item Club is optimistic that further real income gains will translate into a more meaningful pickup in spending growth in H2.  Simon French, chief economist and head of research at Panmure Liberum, said:  Definite signs of a broadening upswing in UK GDP growth despite the very noisy monthly data (+0.4% MoM in May) with the annual growth rate now up 1.4% YoY - the (joint) highest in 17 months. pic.twitter.com/LjlflIkD2b— Simon French (@Frencheconomics) July 11, 2024   Updated at 11.07am BST    7.59am BST   Here is our full story on water bills.   Related: Water bills to rise by £94 over next five years in England and Wales       7.57am BST  'Growth now likely to outstrip OBR's 2024 GDP forecast' – Deutsche Bank  Back to the UK economy returning to growth in May, which is a boon for Keir Starmer’s government. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist of Deutsche Bank, noted that GDP surprised to the upside yet again, expanding by 0.4% month on month, driven by stronger services activity and construction output.  While the warmest May on record may have helped activity in the services and construction sectors, UK GDP is now undeniably picking up steam. The short-lived recession is now very much behind us. It’s now likely that Q2 growth could come close to the mark set in Q1 (our current nowcast models point to a 0.6% quarter-on-quarter reading with risks skewed to the upside). Equally, upside risks to our 2024 growth projection of 0.8% are also now crystallising. This should be a boon for the new Labour government with growth now likely to outstrip the Office for Budget Responsibility’s 2024 GDP forecasts, partially offsetting some of the projected increase in interest rate costs. We will update our growth projections soon.   Updated at 11.06am BST    7.45am BST   During the general election, the Liberal Democrats called for Ofwat to be abolished and a new water regulator to be established with greater powers. Today, the Lib Dems are calling on Ofwat use its existing powers to crack down on large water bill rises. The party is also calling on the government to implement a ban on water company executive bonuses until discharges and leaks end. The Lib Dems’ environment spokesperson Tim Farron said:  Any insulting price hikes by water companies must be blocked. It is a national scandal that these disgraced firms are demanding more money from families and pensioners in a cost of living crisis, all whilst dumping raw sewage into our rivers. After years of Conservative Ministers letting these shameful polluters get away with it, we now need tough action, starting with a ban on bonuses and a block on large bill hikes. Communities spoke loudly at the election, demanding an end to the sewage scandal and water firms stuffing their pockets with bonuses and dividends. The government and regulator must listen to the country.   Updated at 11.06am BST    7.43am BST   In return for being able to increase their bills, water companies must invest in the following, the regulator said: Improving the environment  Delivering more than 2,500 projects to reduce spills from storm overflows  Upgrading over 1,500 wastewater treatment works  Improving or protecting over 15,000km of rivers across England and Wales  Expanding use of nature-based solutions – with £2bn of green schemes proposed  Putting the sector on track to meet net zero emissions by 2050  Improving service  Improving drinking water quality – targeting 21% fewer contacts received by water companies  Stretching targets on reducing sewer flooding  Better customer service incentives – companies only rewarded for good customer service compared to other sectors  Protecting our water and wastewater system  A major expansion in new water assets, including nine new reservoirs and progressing seven large-scale water transfer projects  Delivering 425 million extra litres of water supply per day by 2030  Getting leakage down by a further 13% – to the lowest level since privatisation  The biggest smart meter rollout to date, with 10 million to be delivered  Tripling the rate of replacing water mains      7.36am BST   The water regulator said companies should triple investment in new infrastructure and resources compared to 2020-25, to improve the environment, resilience, and service – from £11bn to £35bn. Nearly 90% of this investment is needed to meet legal requirements. Ofwat added:  Companies have proposed increased support for those struggling to pay, with an estimated 1.4 million more customers to pay reduced tariffs.   Updated at 7.43am BST    7.33am BST   The increases in average water bills range from £66 at Anglian Water over the next five years, £99 at Thames Water, £107 at Yorkshire Water and £199 at Southern Water. Despite the increases, water bills bills are on average £44 per year lower than what companies proposed, Ofwat said in its draft determinations for the water industry.  This is mainly because we have challenged companies’ view of what they need to spend, and because some companies based their plans on an investor return above the level we think is fair.   Updated at 7.34am BST    7.21am BST  Introduction: UK economy grows by 0.4% in May; households face £94 water bill increase over next five years  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. England are through to the final in the euro men’s football tournament, and the UK economy has returned to growth. In other news, the average water bill is set to rise by £94 over the next five years in England and Wales, the water regulator Ofwat said. The 21% increase, or £19 a year on average, is intended to fund investment at water companies for improvements such as fixing leaking pipes and tackling the discharge of sewage into rivers and seas. Is is lower than water companies had asked for. The UK economy grew by 0.4% in May after showing no growth in April, resuming its recovery from last year’s recession, according to official figures. April was a very wet month, putting consumers off from spending on the high street. The outcome is better than the 0.2% growth forecast by econommists. GDP grew by 0.9% in the three months to May compared with the the three months to February, driven by 1.1% expansion in services output, according to the Office for National Statistics.   Related: UK economy returned to growth in May   In May alone, services output rose by 0.3%, the same rate as in April (revised up from 0.2%), and was the biggest contributor to growth. Production output grew by 0.2% in May following a drop of 0.9% in April, and posted zero growth in the three months to May. Construction output grew by 1.9% in May, following a fall of 1.1% in April (revised higher from a fall of 1.4%), and declined by 0.7% in the three months to May.  GDP grew 0.4% in May 2024.

      "Jet2 has said price rises for its flights and package holidays will be “modest” over the summer, as it tries to adjust to a trend for late booking in which customers are waiting much longer to buy tickets. The Leeds-based company – which flies from 12 UK airports to more than 65 destinations in Europe – said that it was conscious of the pressure on consumers, and that although it was having to raise prices, its deals would remain “attractive”. “Passengers are currently booking much closer to departure and therefore pricing for our flight-only and package holiday products must remain attractive,” Jet2 said. The company said it had already raised the price of its package holidays by 11% to £830, on average, over the year as it tried to cover its own rising costs. “As ever, we remain mindful of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and how these may influence future consumer spending patterns,” the company added. “However, we continue to believe that the end-to-end package holiday is a resilient and popular product which remains high on the priority list for our customers, even during uncertain economic times.” The group reported a 43% jump in profits on Thursday to £530m for the year to March, as passenger numbers rose 9% to a record 17.7 million. There will be some relief for holidaymakers flying out of Heathrow, after the UK regulator said it would be forcing the airport to make further cuts to passenger charges over the next two years. The Civil Aviation Authority said Heathrow would probably have to reduce the per-passenger fee – the amount charged to airlines for each traveller they carry – by about 6% over the next two years, to £23.73 in 2025 and £23.71 in 2026. That is only down marginally from the £25.24 cap set for this year but the issue is complicated by the fact that Heathrow had originally tried to increase the fee to £40, before losing an appeal with the competitions regulator. Heathrow said it had experienced its busiest day ever on 30 June as more than 268,000 passengers passed through the airport – a contrast to the hit from the Covid lockdowns, for which it had been hoping to compensate through higher charges. The chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said: “June has seen more Heathrow records shattered including serving more passengers in a single day than ever before … We have started summer as we mean to go on.”\n",
      "Etsy has always been a home for sellers of bespoke, artisanal and alternative items – including erotic jewellery and sex toys. But as of next month, some of these companies will be kicked off the platform, which they see as a betrayal of Etsy’s sizeable sex-positive community. From 29 July, Etsy will ban the sale of sex toys, such as dildos and vibrators as well as “printed or visual materials” that exist for “the purpose of sexual arousal or stimulation”, including old Playboy issues and vintage adult magazines, and anything printed with sexual slogans related to “daddy” or “mommy”. The new policy is the company’s attempt to “continue to keep our users safe”, wrote Alice Wu, the head of Etsy’s trust and safety team, in a public letter. Sellers see this as a betrayal, according to Alexandra Houston, the founder of London-based e-commerce platform Charmskool, which specialises in fetish apparel and accessories. Since the announcement, she has seen an influx of former Etsy users to her platform. “The huge crushing disappointment is that a previous ally [Etsy] is turning its back on this community without so much as an apology,” she said. “Imagine if you have been trading on Etsy for the last 10 years … it’s like having your house burnt down.” The company now catered “to the mass market”, Houston said. “Etsy wants anything creative as long as it is beige, and middle of the road. It doesn’t want anything risque any more.” Preston Stevenson and Laura Norden, who have been selling handmade dildos and other sex toys from Ohio since 2018, agree.  “The ban will essentially close the doors of many handmade makers in the adult toy realm like ourselves. For small shops like ours who have spent the majority of their time on the Etsy platform, 30 days’ notice is simply not enough time to pivot either to a new shop home with the same amount of traffic or exposure or ramp up in-person sales,” Stevenson said. “Bans like this one also further the idea that sexual health and pleasure is somehow taboo or something to be ashamed of. It has broader impacts on society as a whole.” The founders of Simply Elegant Glass, which makes sex toys, posted an open letter to Etsy on X, noting it was already hard to run an adult business, since most payment processors “have prurient clauses and won’t work with us”.  They wrote: “Protecting children from adult content is a noble interest and we agree that it should be pursued – no question whatsoever. That’s not an honest framing of what you’re doing here, though, is it? “A blanket ban is a lazy solution to the problems of non-compliance and non-enforcement that you [Etsy] … created in the first place. It’s a solution that targets buyer retention and that appeases investors and advertisers. It’s a bad solution – even when framed around ‘safety’.” Simply Elegant Glass said it had been a “loyal Etsy seller since 2015, selling artistic, handmade, one-of-a-kind goods”, with 5,000 shop followers and hundreds of five-star reviews. Etsy introduced cost-cutting measures last year, including laying off 225 workers. It faces growing competition from websites such as Temu and Shein, which sell products at cheaper prices. It also reported first-quarter profits of $63m (£49m), down more than $11 from the year before, due to weak consumer demand. It is understood the decision by Etsy is to promote user safety and not for financial benefit. Etsy did not provide a comment.\n",
      "The UK economy returned to growth in May after a washout month in April when activity flatlined, resuming the recovery from last year’s recession. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product rose by 0.4% month on month, double what City economists had forecast, after recording zero growth in April when wet weather hit consumer spending.  In the first week since Labour’s election landslide, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has promised to reboot the economy by making it the new government’s “national mission” to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7. Growth was widespread in May across all main sectors of the economy. The ONS said retailers had a good month, bouncing back from a weak April, while strength in housebuilding and infrastructure helped construction grow at the fastest rate in almost a year. Manufacturing also grew, led by the food and drink industry. Over the three months to the end of May the economy grew by 0.9%, the fastest rate for more than two years. Keir Starmer has become prime minister as the economy recovers from a brief and shallow recession at the end of last year, when households cut back their spending amid the cost of living crisis. Rishi Sunak had argued during the election campaign that the economy had “turned a corner” under the Conservatives. Growth returned in the first quarter of this year, with the economy expanding by 0.7%. However, it flatlined in April, the first month of the second quarter, as wet weather deterred consumers from spending on the high street, while millions of households remain under pressure amid the cost of living crisis. Inflation has returned to the government’s 2% target after a prolonged period of soaring price rises and a peak inflation rate of 11.1% in October 2022 – its highest level in 41 years. As inflation comes down, the Bank of England is expected to start cutting interest rates, possibly as soon as next month, in a move that will provide relief and hope for households facing sharply higher mortgage costs. However, markets predict the Bank’s next meeting in August is on a knife-edge, after comments by policymakers this week warning that persistent inflationary pressures could warrant a cautious approach. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “These GDP figures may make an August rate cut less likely by providing those rate setters, who are concerned about underlying price pressures, with sufficient confidence about the UK’s economic recovery to continue putting off loosening policy.” Reeves said the government had “taken the urgent action necessary to fix the foundations of our economy to rebuild Britain and make every part of Britain better off. A decade of national renewal has begun, and we are just getting started.” The latest figures show growth was led by a robust 0.3% month on month expansion in the service sector, which accounts for most the British economy, in a fifth consecutive month of recovery. This was driven by growth of 2.9% in the retail trade, after a fall of 1.8% in April. The hospitality sector also bounced back after a washout April, mainly coming from hotels, and to a lesser extent restaurants and pubs. Breweries also had a positive month. It comes after UK overall rainfall in April was 155% of the long-term average, while May was the warmest on record since records began in 1884. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said while the near-term outlook for the economy had improved, there were still challenges for the government to address. “The longer-term outlook for productivity in both the public and private sectors, key drivers of long-term growth prospects, remains weak. The announcement this week of supply side reforms by the new government is encouraging, but these policies, if successful, will take time to alter the long-term growth trajectory.”\n",
      "The City watchdog will trigger the biggest shake-up of London stock market rules in more than 30 years this month, in an attempt to make the UK a more attractive place to list shares. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed on Thursday it would streamline and loosen rules for listed companies on 29 July, after months of hand-wringing over an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange for rival financial hubs. The revamped rules will scrap the UK’s two-tier system of standard and premium listings. The premium listing heaped extra requirements on companies in exchange for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. Ditching the premium label means companies will no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving large mergers or takeovers. While current rules have been criticised by some for delaying or increasing the cost of standard deals meant to help companies grow, the change has raised concerns about eroding shareholder democracy. Companies will soon operate under one set of rules, simplifying what some industry bodies have claimed was a “complex” and costly listing regime. “Our aim is to encourage a wider range of companies to choose to list, raise capital and grow in the UK, while maintaining high standards of market integrity and consumer protection,” said the FCA’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi. The changes are a result of recommendations put forward in 2021 by Jonathan Hill, a former EU commissioner for finance. The FCA has already slashed the proportion of shares that must be offered to outside investors from 25% to 10%, and allows companies to issue dual-class shares that give founders more control of listed firms, in response to Lord Hill’s report. Both sets of rules came into force in December 2021. It is also hoped that the latest changes reduce the number of companies leaving or snubbing London for overseas rivals, including the US. “The need for change is clear and widely acknowledged,” Rathi said. “The risk otherwise is that our regime falls increasingly out of step with those of other jurisdictions, making it less likely that companies eager to grow choose the UK as a place to list their shares.” The investment platform AJ Bell said the overhaul came with “some serious potential negatives”. “The government is clearly desperate to bolster UK listings as part of efforts to revitalise the City of London,” said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell.  “The FCA’s reforms risk diluting the quality of the UK stock market to a house made out of balsa wood. This includes giving shareholders less of a voice on matters like acquisitions, even though they are a company’s owners.” In May, the owner of Paddy Power, Flutter, announced it would switch its primary listing to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to convince it to float in London. The British fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown said in June it would accept a proposed offer from private equity investors, which would leave another hole in the FTSE 100 index.\n",
      "Government officials who tour Coppermills, a vast Thames Water treatment works in north-east London, are left under no illusions about the dire condition of Britain’s infrastructure. “It’s in a shocking state,” said one official who has visited the 1960s site, which supplies approximately a third of the capital’s population with drinking water and sewage services. “It’s a slow-motion management disaster.” Thames has publicly admitted that Coppermills is in such poor condition that it could be a “point of failure”, leading to prolonged water supply disruption for more than 500,000 people. Coppermills is just one corner of a huge, decaying empire that serves 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley. Evidence of that decay has become all too frequent: from the rivers clouded with sewage when it rains, and the burst pipes and water mains, to the threatened water shortages when the sun shines. A slow-moving crisis that has engulfed Thames has left it teetering on the brink of a painful restructuring, or even a temporary renationalisation. Thames has also become a powerful totem of mismanagement, corporate greed and lax regulatory oversight. And for a new Labour government coming to terms with its economic inheritance, Thames is a timebomb that is about to detonate. New breed of investors The roots of that decay can be traced back more than two decades. In the early 2000s, as the government prepared to shunt two renationalised companies, Railtrack and British Energy, back into private hands, the message to regulators was clear: play nice and do not put off foreign investors. It was against this backdrop of light-touch regulation that Macquarie, which started out as a small Australian merchant bank in the 1960s, decided to buy Thames Water in 2006. Britain’s privatisation wave, kicked off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was entering a new phase. The early owners were cashing in their lucrative investments, and a new breed of financially savvy investors was circling. The Macquarie-led consortium outmuscled investment heavyweights – including the gas-rich state of Qatar and Guy Hands’s Terra Firma – to land the £8bn acquisition from German’s RWE. Macquarie pruned costs ruthlessly. Thames Water lifer Cliff Roney, who had a four-decade career within the company before retiring in 2018, recalls a perceptible shift when it took over from RWE. “When Macquarie arrived, they presented a glossy presentation to us, promising investment in assets and staff. Within months, it was clear we’d been sold a pup,” he says. “Some important sites needed in case of water shortages were sold off. They were so tight on spending, you could barely order a box of pens. All the skills were contracted out – we had electricians, blacksmiths, window fitters – they were all outsourced under Macquarie.” Parsimony even extended to the boardroom – although not where pay was concerned. When Martin Baggs left his job running Thames Water in late 2016, he might have expected a lavish celebration, or at least a gold watch. Baggs had spent seven years as chief executive churning out profits and dividends for Macquarie. But in recognition of his service, Baggs and his top team were each presented with a tea towel. “It had self-portraits drawn by the directors – they didn’t even pay for a designer to create them,” says a former Thames executive. “Macquarie ran a very tight ship: if money didn’t need to be spent, it wasn’t.” They added: “I’m not saying they’re not the bad guys in this, but they were responsible in the core running of the company. If you needed to buy vital chemicals, you could buy them – you just couldn’t buy any more than was absolutely necessary. It was all very precise. They would not leave any dividends if that could be taken out.” Hollowed out  Interactive  But money was flowing, elsewhere. A £656m dividend was extracted in the first year of Macquarie’s stewardship, in 2007, dwarfing the company’s profits of £241m. Thames churned out dividends of more than £200m in each of the seven years which followed. It carved Thames up into a complex corporate structure, layering debt across multiple tiers of companies. This so-called whole-business securitisation even involved setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. The consortium would ultimately take out £2.8bn during Macquarie’s ownership, representing two-fifths of the total £7bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022, according to Guardian analysis. Macquarie said £1.1bn was paid out to all shareholders, with its funds receiving £508m. Its current owners – which include Canadian pension fund Omers, the UK universities pension fund and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund – have not taken a dividend since 2017, although “internal” dividends have been paid to service debts higher up its complex corporate structure. Thames Water, which was privatised with zero debt, saw its debts swell from £3.4bn in 2006 to £10.8bn in 2017, when Macquarie sold its final stake. The pension position went from a £26.1m surplus in 2008 to a £260m deficit in 2015. “They left Thames in a crumbling state,” says Roney. From 2004 to 2019, there were “grotesque excesses” of debt amassed at water companies, including Thames, while dividends grew fatter, a senior water industry source said. “It was asset stripping, pure and simple.” A Macquarie spokesperson said: “Debt increased in line with the company’s asset base, which doubled due to the record £11bn of investment delivered over the period.” The highest profile Macquarie executive linked to Thames is Martin Stanley, its former head of asset management, whose division oversaw Thames Water transactions. He earned £10m in 2021, the year he stepped down from the role.  Interactive  Irked by “misconceptions” about utility investors, another Macquarie executive, Martin Bradley, the head of asset management, who oversaw the Thames transactions, wrote to the Financial Times earlier this year arguing that the consortium had kept bills affordable and invested £11bn in network upgrades.  The company has even taken the unusual step of addressing media “mischaracterisations” online. The Macquarie spokesperson said: “We have had no influence over the decisions taken at Thames Water in the seven years since our managed funds sold their final equity stake. During the 11 years in which our funds were shareholders in Thames Water, we oversaw the largest investment programme in the company’s history and the highest rate of investment per customer in the industry.” Concerns about underinvestment in the water industry amid the broader challenges of the climate crisis and population growth led to a National Infrastructure Commission report in 2018 which underlined the need for greater drought resilience and leakage reduction. It is still issuing such warnings, saying in 2023 that “a lot more still needs to be done”. In the aftermath of that report, long-mooted plans for reservoirs finally advanced, including a reservoir to the south-west of Abingdon in Oxfordshire – although it still remains the centre of an intense local tussle. By the time Macquarie cashed in its stake, work had begun on the much-debated Thames supersewer, a separate project that sits outside Thames Water’s ownership but which will ultimately be paid for by Thames customers. It was hard to find a corner of British infrastructure free from the bank’s reach. From airports such as Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton to the gas pipe network manager Cadent, Macquarie was now deeply embedded in the UK’s critical national infrastructure. Its link to Cadent would prove handy – insiders say Sir Adrian Montague’s position as Cadent’s chair, and experience dealing with Macquarie, contributed to his appointment as chair of Thames in July last year, parachuted in to handle its turnaround. But along with those assets, Macquarie has acquired a mixed reputation among financial services professionals. Three current lenders to Thames criticised its approach during its time as a major shareholder at the company, saying its behaviour had reflected poorly on the rest of the investment community. Outrage grows In March 2017, Britain’s biggest water company was hit with a huge fine – a precursor of what was to follow. It was just eight days after Macquarie had sold its final stake in Thames to investment managers controlled by Omers and the Kuwait Investment Authority. The Environment Agency’s prosecution led to a record £20.3m penalty, imposed after the emergence of huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries which had led to serious impacts on residents, farmers and wildlife, killing birds and fish. The incidents, in 2013 and 2014, took place at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. “This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,” said Judge Francis Sheridan, delivering the sentence at Aylesbury crown court. “One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.” In the four years after Macquarie’s exit, Thames was fined £32.4m for 11 water pollution cases, including £4m for discharging an estimated half a million litres of raw sewage into the Seacourt and Hinksey streams in Oxford. In 2023, it was fined £3.3m and called “reckless” over a 2017 incident which saw millions of litres of raw sewage enter two rivers near Gatwick airport. That came on top of £12m of penalties for late or badly managed roadworks in London. The fines were also racking up elsewhere: in 2021, Southern Water was fined a new record of £90m by the Environment Agency for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the seas off north Kent and Hampshire over several years. Between 2015 and the summer of 2023, there were 59 prosecutions of water companies in England, with fines handed down by the courts of over £150m. As the fines mounted, so did the public outrage, led by a clutch of vociferous campaigners, notably the former lead singer of the Undertones, Feargal Sharkey. Financial implosion The political winds started to shift, with the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, saying in 2018 that water companies “have not been acting sufficiently in the public interest.” Some had been “playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment”, hiding “behind complex financial structures” to avoid scrutiny, he said. Ultimately, it had allowed “failures to persist for far too long”. But the wheels of regulation turn slowly. Ofwat’s concerns were building in 2018, 2019 and 2020, according to insiders who were working on issues such as dividends at the time. In 2017, the Cayman subsidiaries were ordered to be shut down. “By the time Macquarie left, it was abundantly clear that it had ransacked Thames,” a former Ofwat board member told the Guardian. “It might have been after that particular horse had bolted, but Ofwat did take steps to try and stem the tide of dividends.” But it was ultimately only last year that Ofwat gained new powers to stop the payment of dividends to shareholders if they threatened a water company’s financial resilience.   Related: Thames Water to shut Cayman Islands subsidiaries under new chairman   And despite the catastrophic financial position it left Thames Water in, Macquarie made a shock return to the English water industry in 2021, taking control of troubled Southern Water and injecting £1bn to save it from possible renationalisation. Its surprise comeback came with a warning from the then chair of Ofwat, Jonson Cox, who told Macquarie that “very profound changes” would be required at Southern. Macquarie said that the regulator had welcomed its investment in struggling Southern Water. Ofwat faced a worsening conundrum. The water monopolies were so heavily indebted that fines risked further undermining their financial resilience. By 2021, mounting outrage over sewage discharges had reached a climax. In November of that year the Environment Agency and Ofwat announced separate, parallel investigations into “potential widespread non-compliance at wastewater treatment works”. Meanwhile, financial problems at Thames were starting to mount. Sarah Bentley, the latest chief executive to promise to turn around the struggling utility, abruptly resigned in June 2023. Before the week was out, it emerged that the government had begun contingency planning for the collapse of Thames, and that Montague would become chair. Accounts differ on the reasons for Bentley’s departure. Industry sources claim she was frustrated with a lack of available funds to turn around Thames more quickly. Montague told MPs she was “feeling the burdens of office were quite considerable”, before hastily apologising. “Sarah Bentley became known as the Scarlet Pimpernel: she was barely seen and only communicated with most staff through emails and bulletins,” recalls Roney. Across English and Welsh water companies, fraught negotiations with Ofwat were under way over how much they could increase bills by for their next five-year spending cycle, due to run from 2025 to 2030. But cash was running out. In July 2023, Thames said it had secured £750m of emergency funding from its shareholders to run to March 2025 and indicated that a further £2.5bn would be needed to cover the five years to 2030. By December, Thames’s complex financial structure was the source of intense examination in Westminster, and had been described by one MP as an “absolute shambles”.  Interactive  The arrival in January of Chris Weston, the former British Gas executive who was most recently boss of power generator Aggreko, was a last roll of the dice by its despairing shareholders. The £2.3m-a-year chief executive was “the bolshiest utilities executive they could find,” sources said. But not everyone is convinced of this: another former colleague says Weston had a reputation for indecision at Centrica, notably when he was running its North American subsidiary Direct Energy. “The joke was Chris was much like the Canadian weather – if you didn’t like his decision, just hang around for half an hour and it will change,” a source recalled. In March, shareholders dropped a bombshell: they pulled the plug on the first £500m tranche of the £750m committed the prior summer, deeming the company “uninvestable”. Ministers showed little sympathy – Gove called Thames “arrogant”. With no more shareholder cash forthcoming amid the standoff with Ofwat, Thames’s parent company, Kemble, told its creditors in April it would be unable to pay a £190m loan due at the end of that month. Inside Whitehall, contingency planning for Thames’s failure gathered pace. A team set up inside government to study the Thames situation in 2023, codenamed Project Timber, drafted a blueprint for turning Thames into a publicly owned arm’s-length body. Lenders would be forced to take heavy losses – with the rest of its £15.6bn of debt added to the public purse. Its dire situation was described as a “critical risk” to the country in briefings to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, within days of them taking office.   Related: Thames Water nationalisation plan could move bulk of £15bn debt to state   A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We have set out an ambitious business plan for the next five years, and with consistent leadership and priorities, time and resources, and the appropriate regulatory determination, we will turn around this business and make it perform for all our customers, the environment and our wider stakeholders.” The special administration regime for water monopolies, hastily drawn up when the industry was privatised in 1989, was updated. The changes now allow companies to enter administration and ultimately be sold as a going concern after their debts are restructured, rather than liquidating the company. Crucially, the rules have been rewritten to protect taxpayers, ensuring any state support issued would now need to be repaid, before even secured creditors. The company’s fate now rests on how generous Ofwat is with its first ruling on its spending plans on Thursday. Thames has been lobbying desperately to allow it to pay dividends up to Kemble, increase bills by up to 59% and receive smaller fines, but it is unlikely to receive a warm reception. A damaging restructuring for investors and lenders – or even temporary renationalisation – looks inevitable. Ofwat’s final view on bills increases will be released in December. Thames, its investors and – quietly – Macquarie will hope it is still in private hands by that point. The 35-year privatisation experiment looks set to culminate in a crisis that the new Labour government will have to clear up.\n",
      "BP has predicted that the world’s demand for oil will peak next year, bringing an end to rising global carbon emissions by the mid-2020s amid a surge in wind and solar power. The energy company’s influential outlook report has found that oil use will increase by about 2m barrels a day to peak at about 102m in 2025 across both of its forecasts. The first forecast scenario shows the world’s current energy transition trajectory and the other shows the pathway to meeting global net zero targets by 2050. BP predicts in both scenarios that carbon emissions will reach a peak in the middle of the decade amid a rapid expansion of wind and solar power as technology costs continue to fall. However, the report sets out starkly different pathways for the future demand for gas, which has emerged in recent years as key growth area for energy companies including BP. Under the report’s net zero scenario, gas use would peak around the middle of this decade before halving by 2050, compared with 2022 levels. But the current trajectory suggests gas demand will continue to grow throughout the forecast, expanding by about a fifth by 2050. In the scenarios, demand for liquefied natural gas, which is cooled to be transported on ships, climbs by 40% and 30% above 2022 levels respectively. The report also suggests higher-than-expected oil consumption in the 2030s compared with BP’s previous forecasts, which would pose a serious threat to the world’s climate targets. The oil company said its forecasts for the current global trajectory, which included climate policies already in place, showed the world would breach the carbon budgets keeping global temperatures from rising above 2C above preindustrial levels. Under the current trajectory oil demand is expected to fall to 97.8m barrels a day in 2035, which is 5% higher than last year’s BP forecasts. The net zero model predicts demand will remain at 80.2m barrels in 2035, up 10% on last year’s outlook. BP said oil would continue to “play a significant role in the global energy system for the next 10-15 years”. The company attracted anger from environmental campaigners after watering down a pledge to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels, to a 25% decline after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ignited a surge in global energy market prices. The outlook’s findings are likely to stoke fears that the global shift away from fossil fuels towards clean power may be slowing, in part due to rising energy demand in developing economies. Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, said the world was in an “energy addition phase” during which the consumption of both low-carbon energy such as renewables and fossil fuels was increasing. In order to keep a cap on rising emissions, low-carbon sources would need to roll out at a pace that matched the increase in global energy demand, Spencer added. BP’s outlook predicts wind and solar power capacity will increase eightfold by 2050 under the world’s current climate policies and by a factor of 14 under its net zero scenario, compared with 2022 levels. Expansion in renewable energy projects is expected to be concentrated in China and developed economies over the next decade, accounting for about 30% to 45% of the increase in new capacity across BP’s two scenarios. The rapid expansion in wind and solar power will enable further declines in technology and energy costs that will in turn support more renewable projects, the company said.\n",
      "What is the new government’s policy on Thames Water? We’ll get a firmer guide – maybe – after regulator Ofwat gives its verdict on all the English and Welsh water companies’ business plans on Thursday. In the meantime, all we have to go on is this pre-election comment from Jonathan Reynolds, now the business secretary: “I wouldn’t want to see a nationalisation. I think there should be a solution that falls short of that.” That statement raises more questions than it answers, unfortunately. Which type of nationalisation would Labour not wish to see? A full-fat, permanent return to public ownership? Or also the temporary “special administration” variety in which Thames’s balance sheet would be straightened out before a return to the private sector? If Reynolds merely meant that permanent nationalisation is a bad idea, many of us would agree. The state’s last grand adventure into building infrastructure, which is what water companies do, was the financial catastrophe called HS2. It is too easy to imagine a repeat in which over-worked departmental officials are given the runaround by sharp private sector contractors who would inevitably do much of the actual work at Thames. Customers might end up no better off. But there is a problem if the Labour government is also signalling that it is reluctant to press the “special admin” button. The threat of special administration is surely essential in the current unstable position. It is one way to impose on Thames the solution that has always looked the simplest way out of the financial mess – a debt-for-equity swap in which shareholders are wiped out while bondholders, owed £15.2bn collectively, take a hefty haircut. Thames’s current shareholders, as it happens, have already given up. They have written down the value of their stakes and declared the company to be “uninvestable”. But that still leaves the bondholders, who are hoping to escape intact if Ofwat is sufficiently generous with its increases in bills. The company’s business plan involves a 44% rise over the next five years, which equates to 59% after inflation, to fund the bulk of a £19.8bn investment programme. On that basis, Thames’s management thinks it has a chance of raising £3.25bn in fresh equity from new shareholders while also avoiding losses for lenders. Come on, though, a hike of 59% is extreme. Everybody knows bills have to rise meaningfully, but 59% would smell suspiciously like a case of billpayers bailing out bondholders by stealth. The cleaner outcome would be a debt write-down to bring the leverage ratio, currently 80%, to the 55%-60% level that regulators regard as financially resilient. If Thames was towing, say, £10bn of borrowings rather than £15bn, the balance sheet would be transformed and the company would look a far more investable proposition. It would be a credible re-set moment. Thames would have financial breathing space while its new chief executive attempts the trickier task of improving the operational performance. We’ll see where Ofwat lands on bills, but Thursday’s draft determination is just the start of the horse-trading and political lobbying before the final decision in December. It is why ministers should be careful about what they mean when talking about preferred outcomes. Do not rule out special administration: it may yet be needed to impose a debt-for-equity swap that would probably have happened already if Thames were listed on the stock market. If Reynolds and co are scared of upsetting bondholders because the government is relying on some of the same source of capital to finance new energy infrastructure, they need to get over it. Financial markets are quite capable of viewing Thames for what it is – a special case of extreme financial engineering. On the right terms, they’ll still show up for the windfarms and gigafactories. Worry instead about the fury of Thames customers if they are bounced into a stitch-up for the benefit of bondholders.\n",

      "Households’ hopes of a cut in interest rates have received a setback after the chief economist of the Bank of England warned that key measures of inflation remained “uncomfortably high”. Huw Pill, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC), strongly hinted he would vote to keep official borrowing costs at 5.25% when he said wage growth and inflation in the services sector were proving persistent. “I think it’s still an open question on whether the timing for a rate cut is now,” Pill said in an unscripted conclusion of a speech to the Asia House thinktank in London. Pill’s comments had an immediate impact in the financial markets, which had been betting 60-40 in favour of a rate cut when the MPC meets early next month but now see only a 50-50 chance of a move. Pill was among the majority when the MPC voted 7-2 at its last meeting in late June to keep borrowing costs at 5.25%, but is seen by the market as less hardline than some of his colleagues and a potential swing voter. Jonathan Haskell, another member of the MPC, said earlier this week that he favoured keeping rates unchanged. Interest rates were raised at 14 successive meetings of the MPC between December 2021 and August 2023, taking them from 0.1% to their current level. Pill said not too much should be read into headline inflation – as measured by the consumer prices index – falling back to the government’s 2% target. Instead, the MPC was focused on three measures of inflation persistence: labour market tightness, pay growth and services price inflation. “On the basis of recent out turns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence,” he said. Pill added that there was a risk that inflation would return above the Bank’s 2% target as a strong labour market, resilient wage growth, and prices in the service sector offset cooling energy prices, which have helped to cut the headline rate in recent months. “There is a threat to go higher through the second half of this year, [but] we’re not talking about dramatic changes.” The Bank’s chief economist said there was a danger that focusing too much on the return of inflation to the 2% target in May could lead to “complacency, maybe taking your eye off the ball”. He said the Bank would be “resolute” in focusing on hitting the inflation target. “Not just today but through time.” Asked whether this suggested the Bank would take a cautious approach to setting interest rates, he said: “I wouldn’t back away too much from that.” Despite his cautious approach, Pill said it was still a matter of when, not if, rates would be cut.\n",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the world’s biggest investor in fossil fuels, may have misled investors and the public by backtracking on its already weak climate and environmental commitments, six US senators have warned in a letter to the CEO Jamie Dimon. Although a climate-disrupted world demands stronger action by the financial sector to reduce emissions and protect nature, the Wall Street firm is heading in the opposite direction, say the upper chamber legislators, who include Senate banking committee member Elizabeth Warren. They have demanded clarification about the intentions of the world’s biggest bank. Senator Warren said: “If JPMorgan Chase has misled investors and the public, both Congress and regulators have a range of tools to respond as necessary.” They have given the bank until 24 July to reply. The letter, shared exclusively with the Guardian, reflects growing concern that JPMorgan Chase is watering down public commitments it has made over decades. Campaigners say this poses a structural risk because short-term interests are taking precedence over long-term climate – and financial – stability. JPMorgan Chase, which has $4tn in assets, has been criticised for making profits while the world burns. The letter notes that the company has financed over $430bn in fossil fuel projects since 2016, more than any other institution on the planet. Concerns rose earlier this year when Dimon announced a shift in policy that suggested JPMorgan Chase would dilute its environmental goals. In an 8 April letter to shareholders, he indicated the company was “going to use the word ‘commitment’ much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments”. The senators’ letter said the company reversed its previous promise by pulling out of the Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles, which serve as a common baseline for institutions to manage environmental and social risks when financing projects. Instead of being proactive about the climate threat, Dimon said JPMorgan Chase would wait for “proper government action . . . [that is] not there yet”. The firm also swapped its clear Paris Climate Agreement goal to reduce its emissions intensity with a blurry new “Energy Mix” target that makes it impossible, the senators say, for an investor to know if JPMorgan Chase is doing anything at all to reduce its oil and gas financing because it now dumps this into a blender with clean energy. “Your full set of comments indicated JPMorgan was completely abdicating any role in addressing climate change,” says the letter, which is also signed by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Peter Welch, Bernie Sanders, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley. “This raises questions about the impact of these policy changes moving forward, and about whether you were misleading investors and the public when you made these commitments.” Concerns are also growing that other major US banks are sliding away from their promises of climate and biodiversity action. Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo also quit the Equator Principles earlier this year, a move that climate groups condemned as “shocking” and “cowardly”. At a time of record temperatures and deadly storms, this has led to a public backlash. On the streets, the climate finance movement has staged protests outside several Wall Street institutions, including Citi, Bank of America and major insurers. Pressure also came in the annual banking on climate chaos report, produced by a coalition of environmental groups, which details the investments of JPMorgan Chase and other majors bankers in climate destabilising projects. BlackRock also limited its involvement. Last month, the financial watchdog NGO Stand.earth highlighted JPMorgan Chase among five of the world’s biggest banks, whose environmental and social guidelines fail to cover more than 70% of the Amazon rainforest. The report found JPMorgan Chase made $2.4bn in capital available to companies that operate oil and gas projects in the Amazon and its biodiversity protections applied to only Unesco world heritage sites that cover just 2% of the region. By contrast, the study commended the British bank HSBC, which was once a major funder of destructive projects in the region but has not provided any financing since it adopted a 100% Amazon exclusion policy in December 2022. Ernesto Archila of the Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said banks needed to be brought into line. “They made commitments when it was politically expedient and now they are walking them back. It is really important for senators to call attention to this issue,” he said. “This underlines the need for regulators to take urgent action. Banks should be compelled to take a serious look at their financed emissions, and make effective and transparent plans to address the financial risks associated with climate change. It is clear that a short-term profit motive is driving the behaviour of the banks. It is now up to regulators to step in and prevent those short-term interests from creating structural risks.” JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the record. A representative shared materials showing the company is a major financier of clean energy, as well as fossil fuels. On its website, the bank says it has broken down the elements in its Energy Mix Target to show oil and gas financing. A recent op-ed by a senior executive said banks have a role in supporting the energy transition with capital, but stressed that governments need to take the lead: “To transform the energy mix, boost new industrial activity, and build sustainable infrastructure at speed and scale, governments need to lead by setting necessary enabling regulatory frameworks and policy incentives to transform regional and local economies, reskill global workforces, unblock permitting to develop the backlog of necessary infrastructure, and so on.”\n",

The struggling water company – which serves 2.3 million people across Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire – said it is “in discussions with lenders and shareholders regarding additional liquidity”. The talks are at an “advanced” stage and bosses “expect” to raise the extra funding, but the company has not struck a deal on the investment. “If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period,” it said in a results statement on Wednesday.

The company has confirmed it will decommission its remaining freight trains by 10 October, with a plan to increase the amount of post it moves by road. The move comes as Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), is the subject of a £3.6bn takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Royal Mail began running trains to transport post in 1830, with the service reaching its peak in the lead up to the second world war when more than 130 trains were used on the network. It now runs just six, which are almost 30 years old and considered at the end of their operational lives.   Related: Royal Mail to stop using its own freight trains after almost 200 years       2.45pm BST   Thames Water has failed to complete more than 100 upgrades to ageing sewage treatment works to meet legal pollution limits, the Guardian can reveal. The schemes costing £1.1bn were supposed to cut pollution into rivers by increasing the capacity at sewage works, adding phosphorus removal to the treatment process, and installing new storm tanks. The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe. Meanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company’s new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of £19.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested.   Related: Thames Water fails to complete 108 upgrades to ageing sewage works   The company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24. Ash Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again. “Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.” Smith added: “It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.”     1.15pm BST   A Wessex Water TV advert about its plans to tackle storm overflows has been banned as misleading because it omitted key information about its record on sewage pollution. The Advertising Standards Authority investigated after receiving a complaint about the ad for the supplier, which provides water to 1.4 million customers and sewerage services to 2.9 million people in the south-west of England. The ad said Wessex was investing £3m a month to tackle storm overflows and featured a voiceover that claimed it was “building more storm tanks to increase storage” and “separating rainwater from sewage”, adding that “a better way, for our waterways, is already under way”. The ASA said it had upheld a complaint that the advert, which aired in February, was misleading because it omitted significant information about Wessex Water’s environmental impact. It said the advert should not appear again in the same form, concluding “that the ad omitted material information and therefore was likely to mislead”.

During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company’s product by issuing a motivational message: “I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.” After a round of jokes about “the filthy rich” – because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days – Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl. It later emerged he had been popping out of Yorkshire for a soak at his parents’ and in-laws’ homes. The serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a £50m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. “Public anger exploded,” recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career.   Related: Cheap sales, debt and foreign takeovers: how privatisation changed the water industry   The saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the “dirty man of Europe” on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution.  Updated at 1.15pm BST    12.35pm BST   South East Water’s parent company, HDF Holdings, is owned by NatWest’s pension fund, an Australian infrastructure investor and a Canadian pension fund. The company is already on regulator Ofwat’s watchlist for financially at-risk companies, alongside Thames Water and other regional monopolies. The company’s financial update will be followed on Thursday by a draft verdict from Ofwat on water companies’ five-year spending plans and bill increases to 2030. That will kick off six months of negotiations with Ofwat, ahead of its final decision in December. South East Water has put forward plans that would see spending rise to £1.9bn to maintain and update its infrastructure. However, that would also involve increasing customer bills by 22%. The search for funding comes after South East Water’s owners provided a £150m loan to a unit in the utility group earlier this year. South East Water’s pre-tax loss narrowed to £36m for the year to 31 March, down from £74m the year before. Turnover rose 9% to £281m. It is also still under investigation by Ofwat for an incident in June 2023 when the company failed to deliver water to thousands of customers for more than a week. The consequences could include a hefty fine from the regulator.     12.17pm BST  South East Water says needs cash injection to stay afloat  South East Water said it needs a cash injection from investors to stay afloat, as it gears up for a key ruling from the water regulator on its future spending plans tomorrow. The struggling water firm, which serves 2.3 million people across Kent, Sussex and Surrey, said it is “in discussions with lenders and shareholders regarding additional liquidity”. The talks are at an “advanced” stage and bosses expect to raise the extra funding, but the company has not struck a deal on the investment.  If it is not possible to raise the additional liquidity, the group and therefore company would not have sufficient liquidity for the going concern period.  It added that “the risk that the funding will not be received constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern”.

Martin regularly publishes economic and political commentary alongside his company’s results and has previously voiced support for Brexit and Boris Johnson. However, today he made overtures to Rachel Reeves, as he blamed the previous government for failing to relieve the tax burden on the struggling hospitality sector. Martin said:  The last government failed to implement tax equality between pubs and supermarkets, leading to pub closures and underinvestment. Wetherspoon hopes that the current chancellor, with a Bank of England pedigree, will understand how many beans make five, and rectify this inequality.

When asked how water companies can justify rising bills on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association for the water industry, said:  We have not built a reservoir in 30 years - even though our population has risen by 20% in that time - and that’s because we’ve been blocked by regulators and planning officials around the country. We need to increase our water supply and if we don’t make these investments we won’t get it. Unfortunately the investment will paid for up front by the shareholders of the companies and then slowly recouped over time.      10.48am BST  UK environment secretary to hold urgent talks with water bosses  The UK’s new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned the bosses of Britain’s water companies for urgent alks tomorrow, amid signs that Labour will take a tougher approach to the industry than the previous Tory government. Reed will host talks with executives from all 16 water suppliers in England and Wales, including Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent. The meeting comes as Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, is due to publish draft determinations on companies’ spending plans for the next five years tomorrow morning. Thames Water is in the most precarious position among the water companies. It said yesterday it intended to tap investors for fresh funds as it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse.   Related: Thames Water to tap investors for funds as it will run out of cash by next June   The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Tim Farron, has called for Thames Water to be brought into public ownership. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, the former Lib Dem leader said:  Thames Water is a special case. I think they are the most egregious offender, if you like, and the simple answer is Thames Water should be taken back into administration and directly run by the government for the time being.

The FTSE 100 has regained some of the ground lost yesterday, as airlines and precious metals miners gave the market a lift. The FTSE has climbed 31 points, or 0.4%, to 8,171. The German Dax and the French CAC have both gained 0.3% while Italy’s FTSE MiB is 0.4% ahead.  In London, IAG, which owns airlines such as British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, is leading gains on the FTSE 100, trading more than 4% higher. EasyJet is another big riser, up 2.2%.  They appear to have been boosted by research from TSB showing that Britons are cutting back on DIY and households goods purchases, but are splashing out on one-off treats such as holidays and days out. Stock markets have rallied over the past fortnight on growing expectations of US interest rate cuts. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:  Testimony from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell before the US Senate saw him flag a return to normality in the labour market. While he made no commitment on rate cuts, jobs data is one of the most important influences on the Fed’s decision making because tight labour market conditions and rapidly rising wages can lead to inflation becoming entrenched.      10.00am BST   “Labour may have made a big play of getting Britain building but the industry is not yet responding in kind,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell.  Tellingly, Barratt Developments is expecting a further slowdown in completions in the current financial year. Its year-end trading update shows completions have already dropped dramatically from the levels seen in the 2022 and 2023 financial years and it means Barratt will only be building modestly more homes than it did at the height of Covid when restrictions put building work on hold. The long wait for interest rates to be cut is clearly affecting demand as the cheaper mortgages everyone was expecting this year haven’t materialised, at least not to the extent that was initially anticipated. On a brighter note, there are clearly signs that the cost inflation experienced by the sector in recent years is beginning to ease. Notably, the company is expecting to buy more land going forward which suggests that the current financial year could represent a nadir in terms of the volume of homes built. Barratt will hope its proposed merger with Redrow gets the all-clear from the competition authorities – a combination helping to build scale and, both parties will hope, resilience.      9.57am BST  Travis Perkins appoints ex-Taylor Wimpey boss Pete Redfern as CEO  In other housing news, the building materials merchant Travis Perkins has appointed the former Taylor Wimpey boss Pete Redfern as its new chief executive. Redfern ran Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, for 14 years until 2021 and was involved in the company’s creation –- he was the boss of George Wimpey before it merged with Taylor Woodrow in 2007. He is taking over from Nick Roberts at Travis Perkins, which also appointed a new chair, Geoff Drabble. Drabble also chairs Ferguson, the building materials distribution business listed on the New York and London Stock Exchanges, which mainly operates in North America, and is also chair of the packaging firm DS Smith, and has sat on the board of kitchen supplier Howdens in the past. DS Smith has agreed to a £5.8bn takeover by its bigger US rival International Paper, and Drabble is likely to relinquish his chairmanship when the deal goes through. Housing analyst Stephen Rawlinson said:  The appointments will be a bit of a shock as both might have been seen as entering a quieter phase of their careers but awakening the sleeping giant that is Travis Perkins is clearly too great an attraction. We are surprised at the moves at Travis Perkins but can see how Pete and Geoff could be motivated to get stuck into their new roles, as both will remember what Travis was in the past and how it has declined in the last decade, and the platform for renewal it now represents.  Redfern will receive an annual salary of £760,000, and will be in line for an annual cash bonus and restricted share plan award at the same level as his predecessor. There are no forfeited awards from previous employment to be bought out.

Crest shares, listed on the FTSE 250, rose 2.8% to 245.2p on the news. The company explained:  The boards of Bellway and Crest Nicholson believe that there is compelling strategic and financial rationale for a combination of Bellway and Crest Nicholson. The revised proposal would bring together the strength of each business with complementary brands to reinforce Bellway’s position as a leading UK housebuilder, while enabling Crest Nicholson shareholders to benefit from the scale of the combined business.  A month ago, Crest rejected a £650m approach from Bellway. The business has been struggling, racking up losses in the first half of year. It slashed its dividend in its latest profit warning last month as it continued to be hit by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market.  Updated at 1.24pm BST    9.12am BST  Barratt shares sink on housebuilding target  Barratt, Britain’s biggest housebuilder, said it expects to build up to 7% fewer homes this year than last, sending its shares down almost 3%. The shares are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index this morning, trading 2.9% lower. Barratt expects completions to drop by up to 7% to 13,000-13,500 this year, from 14,004 homes in the year to June. That total was down by 18.6% from the previous year when it built 17,206 homes. Even so, it estimates that adjusted profit before tax will be slightly ahead of its previous expectations. Markets had forecast £355m. First-time buyer activity has stabilised and shown some recovery, accounting for 27% of private sales, up from 25% the previous year. Demand among existing homeowners remained resilient, albeit with continuing elevated levels of sales incentives and increased use of part exchange, at 16% of private reservations in the year. Barratt has agreed to buy another housebuilder, Redrow, in a £2.5bn deal, and both sets of shareholders approved it in mid-May. David Thomas, the chief executive, said the business looks forward to working with the new Labour government on tackling the UK’s housing crisis.  We welcome the new government’s urgency and focus on housebuilding and reform of the planning system as key to both unlocking economic growth and tackling the chronic undersupply of new homes. We look forward to working with government and wider stakeholders to address supply side constraints and deliver the new homes, of all tenures, the country needs.

Almost three-quarters of ophthalmologists surveyed said that outsourcing of cataracts to the private sector had a negative impact on their NHS eye care departments, with 54% flagging a large negative impact and 16% a small one. The survey of 200 eye doctors by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), shared with the Guardian, came after Wes Streeting, the new health secretary, pledged to divert billions of pounds from hospitals to GPs to “fix the front door to the NHS” and met junior doctors on Tuesday to try to end a long-running pay dispute. Nearly 60% of the ophthalmologists polled said outsourcing had a negative impact on NHS staffing, 62% said the same for staff training, and 46% said it harmed the ability of public eye care departments to treat patients with more complex conditions. Issues raised about staffing included the loss of consultants, nurses and optometrists to the private sector.

Britons are cutting back on DIY and households goods purchases, but are splashing out on one-off treats such as holidays and days out, according to a report from TSB entitled How Britain spends. There was a 9.2% increase in spending with airline and travel companies between January and June compared with a year earlier. People spent more on entertainment such as concerts, theme parks, going to the cinema and theatre (up 5.1%), with spending on amusement parks jumping by 20.2%. Spending in pubs is also up, by 7.2% — driven by spending over Easter and the May Bank holidays rather than during the euro tournament, as spending in pubs fell by 2.5% in June compared to May. As people try to manage their household costs, many are shelving renovations or home improvement projects, with overall spending on DIY, electrical and furniture falling by 15.5%. They also spent less on new clothes, down 4%. As food price growth has slowed, supermarket spending has risen by 3.4%. The report, a six-monthly analysis of TSB debit card transactions, shows consumers spent £9.5bn in the first half of the year. While this is up 1.7% compared to the same period in 2023, it is lower than the rate of inflation of 2%. Delphine Emenyonu, head of loans and credit cards at TSB said:  While many household budgets are under pressure, consumers are remaining optimistic – with many prioritising spend on treats such as holidays and entertainment. Consumers are feeling more confident about their finances, and with a potential interest rate cut later in August, we may see increased spending levels in the second half of the year.  In China, consumer prices grew for a fifth month in June, but less than expected, while producer price deflation persisted, with domestic demand in slow recovery mode despite Beijing’s support measures. The Chinese government has sought to revive consumer demand following a lacklustre post-Covid recovery but people remain worried about the housing downturn and job insecurity. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with a 0.3% rise in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists had expected an annual rate of 0.4%. Food prices fell by 2.1% year on year despite supply disruptions caused by poor summer weather. Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said  The risk of deflation has not faded in China. Domestic demand remains weak.  The producer price index fell by 0.8% in June from a year earlier following May’s 1.4% decline. Asian shares remained close to two-year highs hit at the start of the week. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6% to a new record high, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped by 0.1% and the Shanghai market fell by 0.57%. Stocks have rallied on the back of growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates soon, with Fed chair Jerome Powell saying yesterday that the US is “no longer an overheated economy”.

      "Royal Mail is to stop using its own trains to transport post after almost 200 years. The company has confirmed it will decommission its remaining freight trains by 10 October, with a plan to increase the amount of post it moves by road. The move comes as Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), is the subject of a £3.6bn takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. Royal Mail began running trains to transport post in 1830, with the service reaching its peak in the lead up to the second world war when more than 130 trains were used on the network. It now runs just six, which are almost 30 years old and considered at the end of their operational lives. A Royal Mail spokesperson said it was becoming difficult to secure parts for maintenance and, after reviewing plans to acquire new trains, it was decided that using other commercial rail services and increasing road deliveries was a better option. They said: “To improve reliability, increase cost effectiveness and remain consistent with our environmental goals, over the coming months we will cease operating our own trains while continuing to use a mix of rail, road and air to transport mail to all corners of the UK.” However, DB Cargo, which operates the services, said the decision represented a U-turn by Royal Mail, which had previously committed to increase its use of rail freight to meet its ambition of being net zero by 2040. In 2022, the Telegraph reported that bosses had drawn up plans to more than treble postal volumes transported by rail and cut the amount of road deliveries. Andrea Rossi, the chief executive of DB Cargo UK, said he was “profoundly disappointed” by the move to axe trains, first reported in the Daily Mail, suggesting it could result in an extra 10,000 HGVs being added to “our already congested roads”. The company estimates that about 3% of its mail is transported by rail and the additional driving workload would create more than 30 full-time driving jobs. It has 5,000 electric vans in operation, while many of its HGVs are operated using biodiesels. The changes come days after Royal Mail confirmed it was halving the number of daily chartered flights transporting post around the UK, to 18, and forms part of a plan by Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of IDS, to carry out “the biggest network change in 20 years” to revamp Royal Mail’s deliveries. The company has said it will press on with the shake-up despite the ongoing takeover bid by Křetínský’s company, EP Group. The offer promises a number of undertakings and contractual commitments, including maintaining the delivery of first-class post six days a week. The Royal Mail rail service has held an important role in British culture over the decades. It was the subject of the famous 1936 poem Night Mail by WH Auden, and an accompanying documentary, which charted the journey of one of these trains dropping off letters from London Euston to Aberdeen. In 1963, thieves escaped with more than £2.6m, the equivalent of £69m today, after holding up a Royal Mail service travelling from Glasgow to London, in what came to be known as the Great Train Robbery.\n",
      "Barratt Developments, Britain’s biggest housebuilder, expects to build fewer houses this year despite Labour’s pledge to build hundreds of thousands more. Its shares were the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday, dropping by 2.9%, and later trading 2.2% lower. Barratt expects completed homes to drop by up to 7% to between 13,000 and 13,500 this year, down from 14,004 in the year to 30 June, citing “another year of economic and political uncertainty”. That total was down by 18.6% from the previous year, when it built 17,206 homes. Despite lower output, the builder estimates that adjusted profits before tax will be slightly ahead of its previous expectations, amid tight cost control and easing building materials inflation. Analysts had forecast full-year profits of £355m. David Thomas, Barratt’s chief executive, said the business looked forward to working with Keir Starmer’s government on addressing the UK’s housing shortage. “We welcome the new government’s urgency and focus on housebuilding and reform of the planning system as key to both unlocking economic growth and tackling the chronic undersupply of new homes.” The housing market is still recovering from the aftermath of Liz Truss’s unfunded budget in September 2022 that sparked a crisis in the mortgage market. The Bank of England is taking longer than expected to lower interest rates, with financial markets forecasting the first reduction in August or September. Barratt had drastically scaled back land purchases in the last two years but is starting to purchase more land again. This week, the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled a number of measures to “get Britain building again” and construct 1.5m new homes over the next five years. The government will create a taskforce to accelerate stalled housing sites, beginning with 14,000 homes, and hire 300 planning officers in local authorities. Thomas took part in a call hosted by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, with 170 business leaders on Tuesday, and Barratt has further meetings lined up with ministers. Barratt said demand from first-time buyers had stabilised and shown some recovery, accounting for 27% of private sales in the past year, up from 25% the previous year. Demand among existing homeowners remained resilient, at 16% of private reservations in the year, although Barratt said it was having to offer sales incentives and part-exchange to prospective buyers. Meanwhile, housebuilders are embarking on a wave of consolidation. Barratt has agreed to buy another housebuilder, Redrow, in a £2.5bn deal, which both sets of shareholders approved in mid-May. Together, they could build 18,000 homes a year. Crest Nicholson, another UK housebuilder, said that its board would be “minded to recommend unanimously” a sweetened £720m all-share takeover deal from its bigger rival Bellway, if it tables a firm offer. Crest shares rose by 2.9% to 245.4p. A month ago, Crest rejected a £650m approach from Bellway. The FTSE 250-listed builder has been struggling, racking up losses in the first half of year. It slashed its dividend in its latest profit warning last month as it continued to be hit by volatile mortgage rates and slowing demand in the housing market. Meanwhile, the building materials merchant Travis Perkins appointed the former Taylor Wimpey boss Pete Redfern as its new chief executive. Redfern ran Taylor Wimpey for 14 years until 2021 and was involved in the company’s creation – he was the boss of George Wimpey before it merged with Taylor Woodrow in 2007. He is taking over from Nick Roberts at Travis Perkins, which also appointed a new chair, Geoff Drabble. Drabble also chairs the building materials distribution firm Ferguson, and the packaging firm DS Smith, which has agreed to a £5.8bn takeover by its bigger US rival International Paper. Redfern will receive an annual salary of £760,000 reflecting his experience – higher than Roberts’ £675,000 salary – and will be in line for annual cash and share bonuses at the same level as his predecessor.

      "Thames Water has failed to complete more than 100 upgrades to ageing sewage treatment works to meet legal pollution limits, the Guardian can reveal. The schemes costing £1.1bn were supposed to cut pollution into rivers by increasing the capacity at sewage works, adding phosphorus removal to the treatment process, and installing new storm tanks. The upgrades, which were promised in 2018, are being paid for by customers as part of a five-year spending round to 2025 but will not be delivered within that timeframe. Meanwhile, Thames Water awaits a crucial decision on Thursday from the regulator Ofwat on the company’s new five-year business plan. Thames wants to increase customer bills 59% by 2030 to pay for record investment of £19.8bn to tackle sewage pollution, leaks and water shortages after decades in which the company has sweated assets and underinvested. The company is asking the regulator to allow the late projects to be rolled over into the new spending round, known as PR24. Ash Smith, the founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said customers had already paid for the projects to upgrade ageing sewage treatment works, and were being asked to pay again. “Thames Water failed to deliver around 108 schemes that were funded in the last spending cycle and we question whether that a deliberate act to keep it financially afloat. A proper investigation into this company is long, long overdue.” Smith added: “It has broken our sewerage infrastructure while extracting cash, right under the noses of regulators and the government.” Industrywide, water companies are seeking to increase customer bills by up to 91% to pay record investment of £96bn. The new environment secretary, Steve Reed, has summoned water company chiefs to a meeting on Thursday after the Ofwat decision on the PR24 business plans. As well as bill increases, Thames wants the regulator to agree to issue it with lower fines for pollution. Thames also wants Ofwat to increase a 3% limit on capital returns in order to attract vital investment as the company struggles to stay afloat with debts of more than £15bn. Thames has said average annual customer bills would be £608 by 2030. Details of the failure to deliver the 108 upgrade projects on sewage treatment works across the network are contained in a deeply buried appendix to the PR24 business plan being considered by Ofwat. The improvements to the treatment works were intended to fulfil a company target to reduce pollution to zero by 2025. But this week, Thames said sewage pollution had increased by 6% in the past year to 350 events, breaching its legal pollution target and mostly caused by delays to the upgrading of its sewage treatment works. The 108 schemes included upgrades to stop sewage pollution into the limestone tributaries which are the headwaters of the River Thames. The survival of Thames Water, which provides drinking water and sewerage services for 15 million customers, is to a large extent dependent on the decision on Thursday by Ofwat. Thames is seeking new investors for fresh funds. The company said it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse. Its chief executive, Chris Weston, this week blamed last year’s increase in pollution on a 40% rise in rainfall in 2023, saying the ageing treatment works could not cope. But under the Climate Change Act 2008, all water companies were legally obliged to take appropriate action to adapt to the future impacts of climate breakdown, and to provide regular updates on their progress. Thames was first ordered to assess the impact of climate change on its longer term resilience in 2011. The company has blamed the failure to deliver the 108 schemes on macroeconomic events including Covid-19 and the rise in inflation. Thames said supply chain problems were a reason for the delays, as well as pressure from the Environment Agency to force the company to create more storm tank capacity. It said: “We have faced financial and delivery-related constraints which means that a number of schemes will be delivered late.” The company said in its annual report this week: “After decades of underinvestment, it will take time to restore asset health to the level we expect and require.”\n",
      "Tim Martin, the politically outspoken boss of the JD Wetherspoon pub chain, has praised the new Labour chancellor’s economic “pedigree”, as he called for tax changes to help the struggling hospitality sector. Martin regularly publishes economic and political commentary alongside his company’s results and has previously voiced support for Brexit and Boris Johnson. However, on Wednesday, he made overtures to Rachel Reeves, as he blamed the previous government for failing to relieve the tax burden on the struggling hospitality sector.   Related: Rachel Reeves pledges to ‘fix foundations’ of UK economy with growth plan   “The last government failed to implement tax equality between pubs and supermarkets, leading to pub closures and underinvestment,” Martin said. “Wetherspoon hopes that the current chancellor, with a Bank of England pedigree, will understand how many beans make five, and rectify this inequality.” Martin has often lamented the fact that 20% VAT is levied on food sold in pubs but not in supermarkets, which he says unfairly allows thriving shops to subsidise artificially low beer prices, at the expense of the struggling hospitality sector. More than 500 pubs closed in 2023, according to figures from the British Beer and Pub Association, as the industry wrestles with the higher price of energy, rents and labour. While many pubs are still struggling to recover from Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, which Martin heavily criticised for being harsher on pubs in comparison with other sectors, JD Wetherspoon’s 801 venues have consistently outperformed rivals. The company recorded further growth in revenue in the 10 weeks to 7 July, a period that includes most of the Euro 2024 football tournament. Sales were up 5.8% in the period and 7.7% in the year to date, a period in which the company shut 26 underperforming pubs and opened only two new ones. “Sales per pub are approximately 21% higher than pre-pandemic levels, which has helped to compensate for the very substantial increase in costs,” Martin said. He reeled off a list of cost increases since the pre-pandemic 2019 financial year, including a £164m rise in the cost of labour, £28m on energy, £38m on repairs and loan interest costs that are up by £16m. The pub company has sought to boost takings by introducing beer gardens, staff rooms, above-bar glass racks and improved beer dispensing systems. It expects profits to be in line with market expectations, indicating earnings for the year of about £75m. “These numbers don’t just happen by themselves, said Derren Nathan, an analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. “Wetherspoon consistently outperforms its peers and continues to invest in measures to improve serving times and the customer experience. That’s helped it to mitigate an inflationary-led assault on its cost base.” He said an England victory in Wednesday night’s Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, which would book the team a place in Sunday’s final, could provide a “final flurry” before the end of the financial year. The fellow leisure analyst James Wheatcroft, of Jefferies, said he expected Wetherspoon’s to benefit from customers “trading down”, thanks to its cheaper prices, coupled with good locations and investment in the pubs themselves.\n",

It means out of pocket customers who placed orders prior to the company entering voluntary administration have now become, in effect, unsecured creditors – which voids store credits and gift cards too.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Booktopia Group and its associated entities Booktopia, Making I. T. Better, and Virtual Lifestyles, were declared insolvent and went into voluntary administration on 3 July, two weeks after the company suspended all share trading. The ASX-listed company’s net loss between July and December was $16.7m, with net liabilities of more than $20m. “The Administrators are undertaking an urgent assessment of Booktopia’s financial position, whilst pursuing options for completing a recapitalisation of Booktopia or a sale of its business or its assets,” the administrator said in a circular to customers. “The recapitalisation / sale process will operate within a compressed timeline to minimise business disruption.” The payment of all unsecured claims, including customers, will be dependent on the outcome of that sale or recapitalisation, and realisations from other assets, the administrators added. Previous media reports have named Dymocks, Brisbane-based QBD Books and online retailer Kogan.com as potential buyers. Booktopia posted record profits during the Covid pandemic, and by 2021 had outstripped Amazon in market share of the Australian online book sector. The company re-invested profits in expanding and modernising its warehouse, but the increased cost of living, more online competition and a volatile market brought a post-Covid downturn, according to Booktopia’s chairman, Peter George. Over the past year, the company has shed about 100 jobs, which was expected to save the company more than $6m. The first creditors meeting will be held on 15 July.\n",
      "There was a time when privatised British water companies were as unpopular as they are now. During the hot summer of 1995, the managing director of Yorkshire Water, Trevor Newton, achieved notoriety when he urged customers to use less of his company’s product by issuing a motivational message: “I personally have not had a bath or shower for three months.”\n",
      "After a round of jokes about “the filthy rich” – because megabucks pay for water company bosses was also in the headlines in those days – Newton invited the press to watch him washing with a flannel and bowl.

      "The serious aspect of the farce was that, just as now, the public was outraged by the mismatch between rewards for investors and the standard of service being provided by a privatised utility. Yorkshire had just paid a £50m dividend to shareholders and yet the city of Bradford was at risk of running dry. A new grid was behind schedule and the company was reduced to transporting water by tanker through the Dales. “Public anger exploded,” recalled Sir Ian Byatt, the first head of the Office of Water Services, or Ofwat, the regulatory body created at privatisation in 1989, in his account of his career.\n",

      "The saga also underlined the rotten state of the water infrastructure, the reason given for privatisation in the first place. The UK was regarded as the “dirty man of Europe” on account of pollution on beaches and in rivers. Spending by the industry on overhauling its pipes and sewage-treatment works had been falling from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s and now the UK had to meet new European Community standards on pollution.\n",
      "Margaret Thatcher’s administration, which had already privatised British Telecom and British Gas, decided only private capital and stock market ownership could deliver improvements. “Much emotive nonsense was talked along the lines of, ‘Look, she’s even privatising the rain that falls from the heavens’,” wrote Thatcher in her memoirs. “I used to retort that the rain may come from the Almighty but he did not send the pipes, plumbing and engineering to go with it.”\n",
      "More than three decades later, that same infrastructure requires a big upgrade, with bills to soar when Ofwat outlines the regime for the next five years on Thursday. In the meantime, the 10 English and Welsh water and wastewater companies have paid £78bn in dividends since 1989, and accumulated £60bn in debt. Meanwhile, the biggest of the lot, Thames Water, is at risk of temporary renationalisation. Only three of the 10 are still listed on the stock market. Meanwhile, the industry has become synonymous with mismanagement, corporate greed and pollution, as a string of sewage spills, water leaks and hefty fines led to deep public anger. How did we get here?\n",

      "Sold on the cheap\n",
      "To make privatisation happen in December 1989 – a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall – the government cancelled all the long-term debt owed by the previous water authorities and injected cash into the new companies as a “green dowry”. Such exercises meant the net proceeds to the Treasury, even after selling the companies for a total of £7.6bn, was roughly zero.\n",
      "There was, though, the usual quick win for investors in the stock market listings: shares in the 10 companies rose 20% on average within a month. Half the small investors, encouraged to buy with the slogan “You could be an H2Owner”, took their profits and sold their shares within a year. It was a period of corporate exuberance, lampooned by Harry Enfield’s “Loadsamoney” character.\n",
      "But extra spending did arrive. Investment roughly doubled in the four years after the sellout, from £3bn a year to £6bn. Privatisation fans could also argue that the discipline of a stock market listing, plus a smack from an independent regulator, could force underperformers to improve. After Yorkshire’s shambles in 1995, Ofwat sent in investigators, which led to a management clear-out. By the end of decade, the company was top of the class for performance. Byatt also proposed that Yorkshire should return £40m to customers in the form of price cuts and “after some discussion, it concurred”.\n",

      "But it was immediately obvious that the companies had been sold far too cheaply. Customers’ bills went up by a third in the first five years on the assumption at sale that the companies would need ready access to cash to fund the step-up in investment. Debt levels, it was thought originally, would comprise a maximum of only 35% of the value of the assets – the leverage, or gearing, ratio. The bond market, however, was willing to lend far greater sums to monopoly businesses with captive customers.\n",
      "And, strange as it may now sound, the regulator was keen to see financial gearing rise. The rationale was that savings from lower funding costs would be passed to customers in the form of lower bills. Ofwat’s first five-yearly price review in 1994 slowed the bill rises imagined at privatisation; the second, in 1999, cut bills by an average of 12%.\n",
      "The companies were happy to play the debt game. Some, flush with rising share prices and access to cheap capital, caught the diversification bug in the go-go 1990s. Thames won contracts to run water networks as far away as Indonesia and Chile. Welsh Water lost a packet by buying hotels and country clubs. In 2000, Anglian Water bought a construction company.\n",
      "Takeover games\n",
      "Then there were the takeover games, which began when the government cancelled its golden shares in the 10 companies in 1995. Northumbrian Water was bought by Lyonnaise des Eaux of France. Scottish Power bought Southern Water. Enron of the US – before it crashed in scandalous style in 2001 – bought Wessex Water. Water companies were not allowed to buy one another, but some adopted the fashionable notion of “multi utilities” and bought regional electricity suppliers, which were privatised in 1990. North West Water bought its local supplier to become United Utilities and Welsh Water took over South Wales Electricity, restyling itself as Hyder.\n",
      "None of this activity was slowed by a windfall tax on the privatised utilities, water included, imposed by the incoming Labour government in 1997. Thames, for example, was sold for £922m at privatisation but was valued by the stock market at £2.9bn in July 1997; Severn Trent had risen from £849m to £3bn.\n",
      "By the end of that first decade, the privatised water sector was changed beyond recognition. This newspaper reflected in 1999 on “the mixed effects of water privatisation”. On one hand, too much of the extra profits had been “dissipated in ill-advised diversifications, excess dividends and unearned mega-increases in boardroom pay”. On the other, “a lot of money was invested in improving the infrastructure, so that we now have much improved drinking water”.\n",
      "The deal-making kept coming. Thames was bought in 2000 by the German utility RWE, which paid £4.3bn in cash and assumed £2.5bn of debt. The takeover price of £12.15 a share represented a fivefold increase from the 240p at which all 10 water companies were sold in 1989. Foreign capital continued to chase UK utilities and, in the spirit of times, that was seen as an excellent thing. New Labour was not going to mess with the model.\n",
      "Panic stations\n",
      "What followed was a critical turning point. In the early 2000s, Railtrack, after a series of horrendous fatal accidents on the railways, was forced into receivership and turned into Network Rail. Then British Energy, owner of the bulk of the country’s nuclear plants, had to be bailed out.\n",
      "Both events caused political panic, with the City doing its best to stoke fears that foreign capital would evaporate if owners were seen to be short-changed by government action (the unmerited allegation at Railtrack). In the wings, the water sector was still complaining bitterly that the supposed toughness of Ofwat’s 1999 price review left it with insufficient incentives to invest.\n",
      "The result was two actions that, with hindsight, accelerated financial risk-taking. First, in 2002, Ofwat extended the water companies’ operating licences, which were due to expire in 2014. In their place, 25-year rolling licences were granted. “The longer notice period will enable companies and their investors to plan ahead more securely,” said Philip Fletcher, the late head of Ofwat. That was the hope, but the reform also insulated underperformers from any medium-term threat of being replaced.\n",
      "Then, in 2004, the next five-yearly price review was widely seen as a giveaway to the companies: bills were increased by 20%. Water was seen as even more attractive for investors.\n",
      "At that point, takeover action went into overdrive. New buyers were not other utilities, but financial buyers – investment banks, infrastructure funds, pension funds. Macquarie’s fateful £8bn acquisition of Thames from RWE happened in 2006. So did the takeover of the parent of Anglian by a group of Canadian and Australian pension funds. In 2007, Southern Water fell to a consortium including JP Morgan Asset Management after a tussle with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Kelda Group, the owner of Yorkshire Water, was bought by a consortium including Citigroup and HSBC.\n",
      "Former regulators have pinpointed this period as one in which the game changed. Byatt wrote in his book A Regulator’s Sign Off: Changing the Taps in Britain: “Private equity infrastructure capital showed the hard face of capitalism, involving leveraged buyouts and short-term policies, namely high borrowing and high dividends, meriting widespread criticism for its lack of transparency and for its financial engineering.”\n",
      "Jonson Cox, who had spells running Yorkshire and Anglian before he was chair of Ofwat from 2012 until 2022, told a House of Lords committee soon after leaving the regulator: “In the 2000s, investment banks began to realise that there was an opportunity to acquire the water company assets and to put significantly more leverage on to those capital structures. I was not at Ofwat at that time. I have disagreed with that approach and I think it is very unfortunate that it happened.”\n",
      "Investment banks created skewed incentives, he argued, and created “the predisposition of thinking of water companies as financial assets”.\n",

      "Financial engineering on steroids\n",
      "Shortly after Macquarie bought it, Thames embarked on a “whole business securitisation” in 2007 – a fundraising whose banal name belied its aggressive approach. A previously staid business of pipes and sewage treatment works was packaged into a complex corporate structure, with eight layers of ownership – including a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, which allowed debt to be layered on debt, like the tiers in a wedding cake.\n",
      "Suddenly, leverage ratios of 50% or 60% went higher than 80% at some companies taken off the stock market. As Thames explained in 2018, this byzantine corporate structure let it borrow more, with the approval of the ratings agencies: “A higher level of leverage is possible at an investment grade credit rating.”\n",
      "Macquarie has defended its use of a whole business securitisation at Thames, saying it was “very common” at the time. “It was a UK water utility product that was invented, advised and constructed by UK banks,” Martin Bradley, the company’s head of infrastructure, told Infrastructure Investor magazine last year.\n",
      "For investors in Macquarie funds that cashed in via a staggered sale of Thames in 2017, he pointed to annual gross returns of 12%-13%, which he argued were in line with regulatory guidance in the 2005-09 period. “There’s nothing in our returns that I’m embarrassed about,” Bradley argued.\n",
      "The Australian bank has also defended its broader stewardship of Thames, saying the company “undertook a record level of investment despite the returns allowed by Ofwat being reduced”.\n",
      "The legacy of the sector’s debt binge in the mid-2000s era lives on, however. Southern Water, which adopted a whole business securitisation in 2003, had to be rescued in 2021 in what now looks like a miniature version of the financial crisis now engulfing Thames. Controversially, the buyer at Southern was Macquarie, which injected £1bn in new equity to recapitalise the business.\n",
      "It was only belatedly that Ofwat woke up to the dangers of overborrowing. Powers to stop the payment of dividends if they would risk the company’s financial resilience were introduced only last year.\n",
      "One core question about the post-privatisation era is whether the gravitational shift from sensibly capitalised public companies on the stock market to heavily leveraged private entities contributed to the sector’s woeful environmental record.\n",
      "Is it, for example, a coincidence that the two most heavily fined companies over the years – Thames and Southern – were also the two with the most aggressive financing structures?\n",
      "Debt, it should be said, has also been used for its original purpose of accelerating investment, complementing the portion funded from bills. Overall, post-privatisation investment has totalled £190bn. But the overuse of financial leverage, with the aim of maximising returns for shareholders, is undeniable.\n",
      "Current Ofwat chief executive, David Black, addressed the point last year when Thames’ financial crisis became acute: “For most companies, debt has been a prudent low-cost source of finance with low interest rates fixed for the long-term,” he said. “However, some companies borrowed too much, most obviously Thames Water. The risk for this – and for correcting this – belongs to the company and its shareholders.”\n",
      "Therein lies one huge tension at the heart of the recent ruling from Ofwat on the companies’ business plans for the next five years. Investment is needed on a massive scale and customers’ bills are going up substantially, whatever happens. But will the regulator really make the worst debt addicts pay for their borrowing binges?\n",
      "‘If you get a tough job … and you haven’t got a way to make it easy, put a lazy man on it,” a Chrysler executive named Clarence Bleicher once explained to a US Senate committee on productivity. “After 10 days, he will have an easy way to do it.” That quote is often misattributed to Walter Chrysler or Bill Gates. I know this because, fundamentally, I am a lazy man: left to my own devices, I will happily spend 20 minutes on Quote Investigator rather than hoovering the living room or, er, writing a feature about productivity. The problem? I have loads to do. Like many self-styled productivity bros, my weekly schedule includes several gym sessions, a Brazilian jiujitsu habit, practising the piano, writing a newsletter and fostering a couple of side hustles – but I also have a full-time job and a seven-year-old to worry about. While I collect productivity advice like some people collect fridge magnets or Funko Pop! figures, I am ruthless about the tips I actually follow. I don’t journal, meditate or take cold showers; I don’t have 20 productivity apps or an expensive timer. I have a handful of “rules” and heeding them works … pretty well. So, if you are struggling to fit it all in, take some advice from Bleicher, grab some elastic bands (yes, really) and start with the most lazy yet life-changing thing you can do. Write everything down Yes, everything: shopping lists, appointments, jobs that need to be done, ways to entertain a bored child, ideas for that novel you will write if you ever get the chance, all the films and TV shows you want to watch and all the books you want to read. Dave Allen, the author of Getting Things Done, suggests doing this with a complicated system of index cards, but technology has moved on. Put it all in one or two big spreadsheets with separate tabs. It’s incredibly freeing: instead of juggling dozens of ideas in your head, you are outsourcing them to a document. It also cuts down on evenings spent trying to find something to watch across the myriad streaming platforms. But there is one thing I always do in a physical notebook … Ditch the to-do list for a ‘first things’ list The problem with most to-do lists is that they don’t take into account all the stuff you need to do them. “Do tax return” doesn’t work if you haven’t got your receipts in order; “sort out school application” doesn’t work if you don’t know whom to email. With a “first things” list, you split an important task into smaller and smaller chunks until you are left with one “first thing” that you can do immediately (and preferably in less than two minutes). Make a list of those things when you sit down in the morning and it’s easy to start building momentum for the rest of the day. Bonus suggestion: rather than crossing things off your list, put a checkbox next to each item. It takes about 10 seconds longer, but it’s easier to see what you have done – and it’s immensely satisfying. Work out your attention timetable We all have bits of the day when we are fired up and bits when we are not at our best. Maybe you don’t really get going until noon, or your concentration slips after four o’clock. Grab a bit of paper and map out an average working day – start and finish times, breaks, any personal stuff you have to do – and write down when you are most attentive or sluggish. From here, you should be able to calculate the best times for difficult or creative tasks (and work out when you should stick to emails or change the printer cartridge). Obviously, full-time jobs aren’t always respectful of a 3pm lull, but if you have a bit of leeway, try to steer your most tedious tasks towards the time of day when your brain slows down. Use the work-or-nothing rule Raymond Chandler got a lot done. He didn’t start writing detective fiction seriously until the early 1930s, when he was in his 40s, but then wrote seven novels and a handful of screenplays, including two that were nominated for Academy Awards. His advice? “The important thing is that there should be a space of time … when a professional writer doesn’t do anything else but write,” he once said. “He doesn’t have to write, and if he doesn’t feel like it, he shouldn’t try. He can look out of the window or stand on his head or writhe on the floor, but he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, write letters, glance at magazines or write cheques.” Of course, in Chandler’s day, it was easier to avoid distraction; now, it’s likely that whatever device you are writing on can connect you with limitless amounts of stuff to distract you. One option is to work in notebooks or without a connection to the internet. Another is to … Put an elastic band on your phone We have all heard the usual phone advice – put it in a drawer, switch on airplane mode, put a picture of your kid’s face on the lock screen to remind you that you are supposed to be planning for their future instead of doomscrolling – but it’s all a bit too easy to ignore. I can’t ditch my phone entirely – what if the boy’s school wants something urgently? – but anyone who thinks that my smiling child might work as a disincentive hasn’t met me (or him). The only thing that works for me is using a literal barrier in the shape of an elastic band. Wrap one around your screen and it works as a tactile reminder that it’s there for emergencies only. This also helps with the next idea. Set kettle deadlines As a younger man, I used to use boiling the kettle as an excuse to do a handful of press-ups or squats (I worked from home, obviously). Now, as a perma-tired dad, I spend the two or three minutes it takes seeing how quickly I can wipe down the kitchen surfaces or sweep the floor. Another option is to use cups of tea as a brainstorming break. If you are stuck on a work-related problem, the change of venue from desk to kitchen can be enough to get things rolling again. Try ‘progressive’ Pomodoros Productivity coaches swear by the Pomodoro method, named after those tomato-shaped timers popular in high-end kitchens. The idea is that you work for a solid 25 minutes, take a break for five, then come back reinvigorated for the next burst of work. The problem? Sometimes, 25 minutes feels like too much – or you are in the zone and don’t want to stop. An idea I have borrowed from the YouTube creator Mike Rapadas is matching your blocks of work to how focused you feel. Start with a five-minute burst, then carry on if you still feel focused, or take a very short break if you don’t. As you get into the flow, you can make your work blocks longer, until you are cranking out half an hour of intense productivity at a time. Use If > Then thinking This one is about programming your brain to behave better. The idea is that you set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour, rather than making decisions as you go. If you don’t make it to the gym after work, for instance, then do 50 press-ups and 100 squats at home. This saves you from making difficult decisions when you are already tired, stressed or hungry – and hopefully ensures you make better ones. Say ‘I get to’, not ‘I have to’ This is another way to change your thinking: rather than insisting that you go to the gym, practice the clarinet or call your mum, remind yourself that you get to do those things. After all, if you have the time and bandwidth to do those things, it’s often a privilege. Call your mum! Cut out ‘zero days’ I saw this posted by a commenter on Reddit about a decade ago and now people are building their lives around it. The basic concept is that a “zero day” is one where you don’t do anything towards whatever project you are working on, while a “non-zero day” is one where you do, well, something: write one line, practice one scale, do one press-up. The point is to keep the momentum, build the habit and get where you are going. I keep track of non-zero days across everything I am juggling on one bit of paper – a tick for each thing – and try to keep the streak alive across all of them. Start it now, fix it later This is the most important concept I have come across for getting things done. If you have done everything above and you still don’t know where to start on a project, the most important thing is to start and tweak as you go. Go to the gym today and worry about how well it worked your abs this evening. Get a first draft of something done now and fiddle with it tomorrow. Start the thing you want to do and work out the rest in future. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "Campaigners for a four-day working week are preparing a new pilot project on flexible working in the hope that the Labour government will be more receptive to changes in how people work. The pilot project has opened to companies to sign up for a November start, with findings to be presented to the government in the summer of 2025. The campaign for a four-day working week – crucially with no loss of pay – has been gaining momentum in recent years, particularly after the Covid pandemic lockdowns changed expectations around where and when people work. A total of 61 companies took part in the first UK pilot in 2022. Of those, 54 had maintained it a year and a half later. Other projects have run in Germany, Portugal, Spain and Iceland. The latest trial will also look at other flexible working policies, including a shorter working week, flexible start and finish times, a nine-day fortnight or compressed hours, when people work the same number of hours but over fewer days.   Related: Largest UK public sector trial of four-day week sees huge benefits, research finds   The new pilot will be run by the UK’s 4 Day Week Campaign and flexible working consultancy Timewise, with training starting in September. Academics at the University of Cambridge, Boston College and the Autonomy Institute will offer research support. The Conservative UK government was actively hostile to the idea of a four-day week. When South Cambridgeshire district council trialled the change, then local government minister Lee Rowley wrote to the Liberal Democrat-controlled leader asking the council to “end your experiment immediately”. Michael Gove’s levelling up department in December said it would look at using “financial levers” to force councils to fall into line. Joe Ryle, director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, said he hoped that a Labour government will be more receptive to shifting working practices. “With a new Labour government, change is in the air and we hope to see employers embracing this change by signing up to our pilot,” he said. Unlike in 2019, Labour under Keir Starmer did not include a four-day week in its manifesto for last week’s general election. Yet the policy counts as supporters some of the most powerful members of the new cabinet, as well as from the influential Unison union. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, last year urged businesses to look at the results of the first UK pilot. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, repeatedly featured the four-day week on a podcast and a book. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, suggested in an interview last year that Labour would consider the evidence, and that she supported flexible working. And the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is understood to have met advocates of the policy and expressed interest in the idea. Bron Afon Community Housing, a Welsh social landlord with about 400 staff, is one of the first businesses to sign up to the new pilot, while committing to retaining offices and not dropping standards. Unji Mathur, an executive director at the company, said: “We are impressed by the impact a shorter working week has had on organisations’ performance, wellbeing and retention. “We see this as an opportunity for everyone working at Bron Afon to improve our services to customers by unleashing innovation, working smarter and improving our work-life balance.”   Related: Ministers threaten to withhold cash from English councils on four-day week   A six-day week was the norm in Victorian times, but the rise of trade unions and huge leaps in productivity allowed for the two-day weekend to become the norm. Advocates of the four-day week say it can further improve productivity and staff retention and reduce worker absences. The South Cambridgeshire trial found that fewer refuse collectors quit their jobs, planning decisions were faster, and calls were answered more quickly. Out of 24 areas of council work analysed by academics at the universities of Cambridge and Salford, 11 areas improved their performance, 11 had little or no change, while two areas worsened: rent collection and the speed of reletting empty council houses. Ryle said: “As hundreds of British companies and one local council have already shown, a four-day week with no loss of pay can be a win-win for workers and employers. “The nine to five, five-day working week was invented 100 years ago and is no longer fit for purpose. We are long overdue an update.” Claire Campbell, chief executive of Timewise, said it wanted to see more “site-based, shift-based workers sign up because this is where innovation is needed most”. She added that she hoped the change “will benefit worker health and retention”.\n",
      "A Wessex Water TV advert about its plans to tackle storm overflows has been banned as misleading because it omitted key information about its record on sewage pollution. The Advertising Standards Authority investigated after receiving a complaint about the ad for the supplier, which provides water to 1.4 million customers and sewerage services to 2.9 million people in the south-west of England. The ad said Wessex was investing £3m a month to tackle storm overflows and featured a voiceover that claimed it was “building more storm tanks to increase storage” and “separating rainwater from sewage”, adding that “a better way, for our waterways, is already under way”. The ASA said it had upheld a complaint that the advert, which aired in February, was misleading because it omitted significant information about Wessex Water’s environmental impact. It said the advert should not appear again in the same form, concluding “that the ad omitted material information and therefore was likely to mislead”. Wessex Water has been criticised for its record on sewage discharges by the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who has called for tighter regulation on water companies. In May 2023, Wessex was fined £280,000 by a Swindon court for supplying water unfit for human consumption for a three-week period in 2021. Storm overflows are supposed to be used by water companies only in extreme weather but for many years they have been used routinely, discharging raw sewage even on dry days in some cases. Wessex Water argued to the ASA that its advert contained no broad claims about environmental performance but was about the issue of storm overflows. It claimed that the ad took a balanced and transparent approach by addressing the shortcomings of outdated systems, particularly storm overflows and sewers, while providing an honest account of their forward progress plan. However, the ASA concluded that although Wessex’s plan would probably result in environmental improvements, its storm overflow problems had caused harm to the environment and “we considered that was significant information which should have been made clear in the ads”. It said: “In this case, we considered that this ad gave people the impression that Wessex Water was taking steps to reduce environmental damage caused by pollution incidents associated with storm overflow.” Wessex Water said: “We are disappointed with the ASA’s ruling based on one single complaint it received about our advert seen by hundreds of thousands of people … We acknowledge that past environmental performance has fallen below our expectations and we have taken steps to address this.” The ASA last year upheld complaints about other water companies and ruled against two ads by Anglian Water Services after they omitted information about the company’s history of releasing sewage into the environment. It also upheld complaints against Severn Trent Water on the same issue. Separately on Wednesday, the ASA also ruled against Luton Rising, the owners of London Luton airport, over a magazine advert and poster on the London Underground that said: “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks.” The campaign groups Adfree Cities and the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport were among those who complained that the adverts were misleading because they omitted significant information about emissions from flights. Luton Rising had argued that the purpose of the adverts was to show people that mitigating environmental impacts were central to the airport’s expansion plans. Luton Rising said: “The ASA accepted that the specific carbon emissions covered by GCG [Green Controlled Growth proposals] were set out on the Luton Rising website, to which viewers of the advertisement were pointed. They felt that this distinction should have been made clearer in the advertisement itself, which we will do in any future advertisements.” • This article was amended on 10 July 2024.

      "The sugar tax, also known as the UK soft drinks industry levy, was announced in March 2016 and came into effect in April 2018. New research has shown that the levy has led to a significant drop in the amount of sugar in people’s diets across the UK, with the amount of sugar consumed by children and adults from soft drinks decreased significantly, by around a half in children, and by a third in adults, after the sugar tax was announced. Here is a Q&A of the key features of the legislation. What is the sugar tax?  The soft drinks industry levy, known as the ‘sugar tax’, is a levy applied to soft drinks which are produced in the UK or imported into the country. It was introduced as part of the UK’s anti-obesity policy and was one of the flagship policies of the 2016 childhood obesity strategy. The tax was targeted at drinks manufacturers in order to incentivise them to reduce the sugar content of their products. According to the levy, the manufacturers of soft drinks will need to pay:  24p a litre of drink if it contains 8 grams of sugar per 100 millilitres or more 18p a litre of drink if it contains between 5 – 8 grams of sugar per 100 millilitres  When was it introduced?  It was first announced in the then chancellor George Osborne’s budget in March 2016, which was central to the then budget. Osborne said the money raised from the levy would be used to fund primary school sport across England. Commenting on the policy, Osborne said: “I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this parliament doing this job and say to my children’s generation, ‘I’m sorry, we knew there was a problem with sugary drinks, we knew it caused disease, but we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing.” At the time, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the levy could result in a “pretty substantial price rise”, such as 80% on a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola. The levy came into effect just over two years after it was first announced in the budget, in April 2018. What doesn’t the ‘sugar tax’ include and why?  The levy applies to drinks with sugar added during their production, drinks with at least 5g of sugar per 100ml in their ready to drink or diluted form and drinks with an alcohol content of 1.2% alcohol by volume or less. The beverages that are excluded includes drinks that are at least 75% milk, milk alternatives such as almond milk, soya milk, alcohol-free beer and wine, fruit or vegetable juices, liquid drink flavouring that’s added to food or drinks like coffee or cocktails, infant formula and powdered drinks. As the levy only applies to soft drinks, foods which are high in sugar such as biscuits and cakes are not currently included in the levy. Has it been effective?  Before the levy even came into effect, over half of manufacturers reformulated their drinks in order to avoid the charge. Since its introduction in 2018, several studies have shown its effectiveness in leading to a reduction in the sugar intake of adults and children in the UK. In the first year since its introduction, Public Health England said that there was a 28.8% reduction in the total sugar content per 100ml between 2015 and 2018 for the drinks which the levy would apply to. Research from last year found that the levy may have prevented more than 5,000 cases of obesity every year among girls in their final year of primary school since it was introduced, while another study found that fewer children in England have needed to have rotten teeth extracted at the dentist since the levy was introduced.\n",
      "The price of coffee is set to remain “very high” and is unlikely to drop until the middle of next year amid intense pressure on supply chains, the Italian coffee company Lavazza has said. “We have never seen such a spike in price as the trend right now,” said Giuseppe Lavazza, who chairs the company. He admitted that he had been wrong to predict last year that prices would begin to fall this year. On Monday, prices reached $4,300 (£3,356) a tonne. “The coffee supply chain is dramatically under pressure,” he said in comments reported by the Financial Times. “Coffee prices are not going down … [they’re] going to stay very high.” Worsening harvest conditions in its major production areas of Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, and shipping disruption caused by the Middle East conflict have exacerbated inflationary pressures, helping prices reach 15-year highs, he said. For UK consumers, this has meant the price of a 1kg bag of beans rising by 15% in a year, and Giuseppe Lavazza said this could increase by 20% to 25% over the coming year. A flat white at the company’s cafe off Regent Street in central London now costs £3.50 to take away or £5.50 to drink in, reflecting current costs. “We have faced very, very strong headwinds. I don’t see any reason why coffee prices will go down,” Lavazza said. However, this has not dented the “strong trend” of UK consumers turning to beans to make fresh coffee at home, which began when the pandemic closed cafes but has showed no sign of slowing. In 2023, the company recorded net profits of €68m, down from€95m in 2022. Lavazza said: “People love it so much. And we think there’s an environmental element too, of people wanting to move away from using pods.” The UK retail coffee market is worth £1.3bn, growing by 3.9% year on year, according to Nielsen figures, driven by price inflation of 3.8%. Lavazza said sales volumes were up 2.9% in 2023 compared with the year before, or the equivalent of 32m more cups of Lavazza coffee on two years ago. Coffee remains a staple for Britons, who drink 95m cups every day.\n",
      "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is launching a £7.3bn national wealth fund, as part of a drive by the newly elected Labour government to attract billions of pounds of private sector cash for big infrastructure projects across the UK. The NWF, which Reeves said would be established “in less than a week”, is designed to help projects such as ports, gigafactories, hydrogen and steel projects to attract a mix of investment, aiming for roughly £3 of private funds for every £1 of taxpayer cash. Reeves said the fund would essentially operate as a “concierge service for investors and businesses that want to invest in Britain, so they know where to go”.   Related: Dyson to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK; chancellor launches national wealth fund – business live   The investments will then be managed by the existing UK Infrastructure Bank, headed by the former HSBC chief executive John Flint, with support from a revamped British Business Bank, best known for running the Covid business loan schemes. Reeves made the announcement at No 11 Downing Street on Tuesday, after meeting City bosses who made up the specialised taskforce spearheading the project. Participants included Aviva’s chief executive, Amanda Blanc; NatWest’s chief executive, Paul Thwaite; the Barclays chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan; and the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Labour has been crafting the NWF for months, having appointed the taskforce in March to start thrashing out exactly how it would deliver what became a core manifesto pledge for the party in the run-up to last week’s election. The chancellor insisted there would be a clear distinction between the NWF and GB Energy, another publicly owned company proposed by Labour. While GB Energy will focus on the “production of clean, low carbon energy”, investment made via the NWF will seek to deploy £1.8bn to ports, £1.5bn for gigafactories including for electric vehicles, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn for carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen.  Reeves said the new government was in a prime position to attract investment, amid ongoing political uncertainty in other major western economies. That includes the US, where Donald Trump is due to challenge an under-fire Joe Biden in the November presidential elections, and France, where elections resulted in a hung parliament. “I think for the first time in a long time investors will look at Britain and say it’s a country with a stable government. It’s got a clear plan, but clear mandate in the election. And that’s different from some other countries around the world today,” Reeves told journalists. The NWF will soon be established formally in UK law, making it a “permanent institution at the heart of the country’s long-term growth and prosperity”, the Treasury said. A formal head of the NWF is yet to be appointed, though the government said further details would be set out before an international investment summit to be hosted by the chancellor later this year. The announcement came after Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, hosted a call on Tuesday morning with more than 170 senior leaders from businesses and trade associations around the UK. He set out his four key priorities, according to a departmental source: delivering an industrial strategy, which will be the cornerstone of the government’s growth mission; supporting small businesses, described as the “beating heart” of high streets, communities and economy; resetting trade relations and championing British exports; and making work pay. Reynolds told business leaders that decarbonisation did not mean deindustrialisation. He is aware that a key challenge for businesses is connectivity and the grid, and promised a cross-government focus on tackling this. Sarah Jones’s joint role with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, as minister for industry and decarbonisation, will be part of delivering on this agenda. Business leaders asked about streamlining their engagement with Whitehall, opportunities to increase exports, and the importance of digitalisation. Reynolds promised to be “the most accessible” business secretary, with an email address coming shortly to “tell Jonathan”.\n",
      "Holding interest rates too high for too long would threaten economic growth and jobs, the US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warned Congress on Tuesday. “Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” said Powell. During a congressional hearing, Powell signaled that while suppressing inflation remains a priority, policymakers at the Fed are now concentrating on when they choose to cut rates. The US is “no longer an overheated economy”, Powell said, adding that its job market has “cooled considerably” from its surge after the early damage inflicted by the pandemic. “We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress we have seen on inflation,” he told the US Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee. “At the same time, in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face.   Related: What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?   “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.” The American central bank, which raised interest rates to a two-decade high in a bid to bring down inflation, is now considering its next steps. While price growth has retreated from its highest levels in a generation, it has remained stubbornly higher than the 2% targeted by Fed officials, amid persisting concerns over the cost of living across the US. Fed officials are due to convene for their next rate-setting meeting at the end of July. As of last month, most of the central bank’s policymakers expect to cut rates once or twice this year, according to economic projections released by the Fed. Powell struck a note of optimism on price growth. “After a lack of progress toward our 2% inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress,” he said. Following this modest progress, Powell added, “more good data” would strengthen the Fed’s confidence “that inflation is moving sustainably” to its 2% goal.\n",
      "  3.15pm BST  Closing summary  The vacuum cleaner and air-filter maker Dyson is cutting about 1,000 jobs in the UK as part of a global restructure, reducing its British workforce by more than a quarter. Staff were told on Tuesday morning about the cuts as part of moves to reduce the business’s 15,000-strong workforce around the world amid a wider cost-cutting drive. Dyson, which is known for its bagless vacuum cleaner as well as hand-dryers and bladeless fans, has 3,500 UK employees, with offices in Wiltshire, Bristol and London.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, have today instructed officials to immediately begin work to bring together the UK Infrastructure Bank and the British Business Bank under the National Wealth Fund that will invest in the new industries of the future. It comes as Reeves and Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, convene a meeting of the National Wealth Fund Taskforce at No 11 Downing Street to kickstart this work.  Chaired by the Green Finance Institute, the taskforce includes former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Barclays chief executive C.S Venkatakrishnan, Aviva chief executive Dame Amanda Blanc and large institutional investors.  About £7.3bn of funding will be allocated through the UK Infrastructure Bank so investments can start being made immediately, in addition to existing UKIB funding. Reforms will be made to the British Business Bank, which is overseen by the Department for Business and Trade, to ensure it can mobilise the UK’s deep pools of institutional capital, as the UK’s largest investor in venture capital. “Britain is open for business – and the work of change has begun,” declared Reeves.  This new government is getting on with the job of delivering economic growth. I have been clear that there is no time to waste.  I have previously committed to establishing a National Wealth Fund. I am now going further by bringing together key institutions. We need to go further and faster if we are to fix the foundations of our economy to rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.      1.26pm BST   Sir James Dyson founded his company in 1991, after years of trying to persuade other companies to build a vacuum cleaner to his design. The success of the business made Dyson into one of the wealthiest people in the UK, and one of the most prominent inventor-entrepreneurs. The company has branched out from vacuum cleaners into other household appliances, including fans, hand dryers, heaters, hair straighteners and dryers – and even a pair of headphones that doubled as a portable air purifier. But as his prominence grew, Dyson also became increasingly outspoken about the UK economy. That culminated in his backing for the leave campaign in June 2016 during the referendum on the UK leaving the EU. Dyson claimed that the idea that Brexit would harm the UK’s international trade was “absolute cobblers”. In 2016 he said:  We will create more wealth and more jobs by being outside the EU. We will be in control of our destiny. And control, I think, is the most important thing in life and business.  Yet before the UK had actually left the EU, Dyson made his own exit: he switched his company’s headquarters from the UK to Singapore in 2019, saying he wanted the company to be closer to its growth markets and factories in east Asia. Jim Rowan, Dyson’s former chief executive (and now Volvo Cars boss), said that the decision had “nothing to do with Brexit” but was about “future-proofing” the business. However, it prompted criticisms for alleged hypocrisy by Dyson. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it was “staggering hypocrisy” and “a vote of no confidence in the idea of Brexit Britain.”  Updated at 1.29pm BST    1.02pm BST   Dyson intends to continue with its research and development of products in the UK. It will also continue to run the Dyson Institute in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, which employs 160 undergraduate on Dyson projects for three days a week. The Dyson Institute will continue to offer a master of engineering course to all new undergraduates starting this September. Dyson has not indicated how many of its global workforce it is considering cutting. It has about 15,000 employees worldwide.  Updated at 2.15pm BST    12.59pm BST   The Dyson job cuts were decided as part of a review that was started before the UK general election was called in May, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The UK cuts will be subject to consultation with affected workers. Dyson was founded by Sir James Dyson, a billionaire who was once counted as the UK’s richest person. His fortune was estimated to be worth £20.8bn in May, according to the Sunday Times. Dyson has been outspoken on political issues, including being one of the few prominent businesspeople to come out in favour of Brexit. Chief executive Hanno Kirner said:  Decisions which impact close and talented colleagues are always incredibly painful. Those whose roles are at risk of redundancy as a result of the proposals will be supported through the process.   Updated at 2.35pm BST    12.40pm BST  Dyson to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK  Vacuum cleaner manufacturer Dyson has told employees it plans to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK, more than a quarter of the British workforce. Staff were told of the job cuts on Tuesday morning, in news first reported by the Financial Times. Hanno Kirner, Dyson chief executive, said jobs cuts were “always incredibly painful”, in comments to the FT. He said:  Dyson operates in increasingly fierce and competitive global markets, in which the pace of innovation and change is only accelerating. We know we always need to be entrepreneurial and agile. We have grown quickly and, like all companies, we review our global structures from time to time to ensure we are prepared for the future.   Updated at 2.36pm BST    12.11pm BST  Number of non-doms rose in 2023 ahead of crackdown  The number of non-doms in the UK rose in 2023, ahead of what is expected to be a crackdown by the new Labour government. There were an estimated 74,000 individuals claiming non-domiciled taxpayer status in the UK on their self assessment tax returns in the tax year ending 2023, up from 68,900 in the tax year ending 2022, HM Revenue and Customs said on Tuesday. Labour has promised to end the non-dom regime to raise billions of pounds for free breakfast clubs in schools and more hospital and dental appointments. That – and the Conservatives’ copying their plans – prompted some wealthy people to claim they would leave if the status is abolished. The non-dom regime was introduced under King George III in 1799 to allow subjects who lived part of the time in far-flung colonies to avoid paying tax in the UK. However, since then it has become more associated with ultra-wealthy people spending much of their time in the UK while paying less tax than they would if they were “domiciled” in Britain. The non-doms were liable for £8.9bn in UK income tax, capital gains tax and national insurance contributions for 2023, or about £120,000 per person.  The non-doms were liable for £474m in extra tax compared with the year before, likely because of the temporary health and social care levy, which charged an additional 1.25 percentage points in national insurance from 6 April 2022 to 6 November 2022. The number of non-domiciled taxpayers was still 3,600 short of the total before the coronavirus pandemic.     11.42am BST  BP shares fall after oil company predicts lower profits and oil production  BP is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today after it said that it will produce less oil than expected and refinery profits will drop by as much as $700m. Shares in the oil supermajor fell by 4% after it warned that the fall in output and declining profits from its refineries would hurt second-quarter profits. Its oil trading performance will also be “weak” compared with a strong first quarter. The warning will be a blow to chief executive Murray Auchincloss’s hopes to persuade investors that it can close a valuation gap with US rivals. Auchincloss last month froze hiring on offshore wind projects to try to placate investors who are apparently concerned about the company’s green targets. Although BP officially recognises the climate crisis and the need to shift to zero emissions, Auchincloss has slowed its transition away from fossil fuels. BP will also have a charge of up to $2bn as it reviews the future of its refinery in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Reuters reported that analysts cut profit forecasts:  Citi analysts lowered their Q2 earnings per share estimate by 9% while Jefferies analysts expected the update to result in a 20% earnings downgrade.      10.31am BST   Sewage pollution from ageing Thames Water treatment works that have not been upgraded increased last year, causing the company to again fail to meet its legal targets, according to its financial report. Across the Thames Water area, the number of incidents of pollution from treatment works and the pipe network increased to 350, compared with 331 in 2022. The rise was attributed to delays in investment to create more capacity at many of the company’s 400 ageing sewage treatment works. Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said the works could not cope with a 40% increase in rainfall and exceptionally high levels of groundwater. Asked why Thames had failed for many years to invest in upgrading treatment works, Weston repeated that the works were “old”. He said: “They require a lot of development, a lot of investment into things like putting in storm tanks. All of that takes time and requires a lot of investment on top of what we have done already.” The company said there had been a “significant increase in sewage treatment works pollutions” in the year, caused by delays to pollution improvement engineering programmes, as well as the installation of more monitoring at works. You can read the full report here:   Related: Rise in sewage pollution from Thames Water’s ageing treatment works       10.14am BST   The Liberal Democrats – buoyant after their surge in seats at the general election – have described Thames Water as a “rogue firm”, and called for blocks on dividends or bill hikes from the company. Thames Water has long argued that it needs to raise bills in order to pay for investments to upgrade its creaking pipes. However, the Lib Dems found the UK’s polluted waterways to be a strong campaign issue. Many of its election gains also happen to map onto areas supplied by Thames Water – notably the affluent towns up the Thames and into Oxfordshire. Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson whose Richmond Park constituency is bordered by the Thames, said:  This is a complete mess and it’s time the regulator started blocking Thames Water’s planned dividend payouts and eye-watering bill hikes.  Years of inaction from Conservative Ministers has lead to these bill increases and firms getting away with endless sewage dumps and insulting bonuses. It is clear the public want action to be taken to finally crackdown on this rogue firm. The government and regulator should listen to this call.      9.57am BST   The idea of nationalisation of the UK’s water supply did not seem to be on the cards during the 14 years of Conservative rule (although in the case of the railways the party did relax its apparent aversion to public ownership). But could a Labour government be more open to it? The party has firmly said that it is not planning to nationalise the company. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds last month told an election debate that “people should not expect the state to bail out bad investments”. Its hand may be forced if the water company cannot find investors, but some campaigners think nationalisation would be a better deal for taxpayers (as long as shareholders are not bailed out). Matthew Topham, lead campaigner at public ownership campaign group We Own It, said:  Today’s latest crisis is being used to set the scene for the same old story that we’ve come to expect from water privatisation: shareholders mismanage a vital public service and who do they expect to pick up the tab? Households, taxpayers, and our waterways. Water privatisation may have lined overseas shareholders’ pockets, but it failed to deliver for the public or for our rivers and seas. It’s high time that this government takes Thames Water into Special Administration and then transfers it to local councils to run, giving anti-sewage campaigners, local residents, and water experts seats on its board. The public shouldn’t lose twice. Reckless shareholders and creditors should be paying the price for their failure. As Thames Water circles the drain, we have a unique opportunity to join nearly every other country in the world and run our water not for private profit, but for the people of this country who rely on it.      9.29am BST  Rachel Reeves summons City bosses for £7.3bn wealth fund launch  The new chancellor Rachel Reeves is summoning City bosses to Whitehall, as she prepares to launch a promised £7.3bn national wealth fund. Labour has been crafting the fund for months, having appointed a taskforce involving top financial figures, including former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Barclays boss CS Venkatakrishnan, to hash out details of an important manifesto pledge. Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc is among the taskforce members due to gather at the chancellor’s office at Number 11 Downing Street at midday to launch the fund, which is meant to attract £3 of private funds for every £1 of public cash, in a bid to accelerate investment in key infrastructure projects up and down the UK. Those projects are expected to include ports, gigafactories for electric car batteries, carbon capture and hydrogen projects and steel operations  The chief executives of the UK Infrastructure Bank and British Business Bank has also been invited, as both institutions are set to play a key role in the fund, which would otherwise overlap with some of their operations. An announcement is expected in the early afternoon. Members of Labour’s national wealth fund taskforce included:  Chair: Rhian-Mari Thomas, chief executive of the Green Finance Institute Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England  Amanda Blanc, chief executive Aviva  CS Venkat, chief executive Barclays  Hugh Crossley, chief executive of Equitix David Vickers, chief investment officer of Brunel Pension Carol Young, chief executive of USS, the university superannuation scheme   Updated at 11.15am BST    9.20am BST  Thames Water criticised as profits and pollution both rise  Thames Water has been criticised for allegedly prioritising investors over pollution, after profits and the number of pollution incidents both rose. The company on Tuesday said that higher rainfall had increased the number of “pollutions” in the year to March 2024 by 6% to 350, compared to 331 in the previous year. James Wallace, chief executive of River Action, which campaigns against pollution, said:  There is nothing to cheer as this failing water company, the largest in Europe, continues to desperately prioritise the interests of investors and lenders before the health of rivers and river users. As we found recently on the stretch of the Thames used for the Henley Royal Regatta, leaking infrastructure managed by Thames Water leads to dangerously high levels of human sewage entering rivers in their catchment on a daily basis.With a newly elected Labour government promising to clean up our rivers and seas, it is time for urgent action to tackle the freshwater emergency, partly caused by polluting water companies. A good first start would be for the government to properly resource the environmental regulators such as the Environment Agency in England to ensure they can police and prosecute polluters.  Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said that Thames Water’s money “reservoir” was shrinking.  It can still tap funding of around £1.8 billion, until spring next year but it’s a reservoir that’s been shrinking. At the same time, its debt pile is an even bigger millstone and risks pulling the business under. For now, the company is treading water, but it’s been in a more precarious position after shareholders at the parent company Kemble Water held off from injecting cash into the business over a row with the regulator Ofwat regarding how high bills could be put up by 2030 to enable it to pay for critical repairs.      9.05am BST   Thames Water has £15.2bn of debt, up £1.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan, codenamed Project Timber, was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain’s biggest water company if it collapses. Thames said it was “reasonable” to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were “material uncertainties”. These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations. On Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames, last year.

The news sent its share price plummeting by 36% to their lowest since the summer of 2021. The shares at £7.30 are down 63% from their peak above £20 in early 2023. Mark Crossley, the chief executive, said the company was reducing its full-year guidance partly because the end of Covid-19 emergency measures related to automatic Medicaid coverage renewals in the US had impacted its Sublocade revenues more than expected. Indivior, which has been exploring whether to move its main share listing from London to New York, now expects to make an adjusted operating profit of between $285m and £320m this year, down from $330m to $380m forecast in May. However, Crossley remains confident that Sublocade’s “unique profile to address high-powered synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, provides us with a tremendous opportunity to meet the growing and changing needs of patients”. As a result, the company expects Sublocade, an injected prescription medicine that treats moderate to severe opioid use disorder, to hit net revenues of $1bn “as we exit 2025,” and to achieve peak annual revenues of more than $1.5bn. Indivior said:  The group remains confident that given the scale of the US opioid epidemic, which is now being driven by misuse of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, its opportunity to help patients and deliver value for shareholders remains intact.  The company is ceasing all sales and marketing of Perseris immediately due o the “highly competitive market” and payor changes in the US. It will continue to supply Perseris “for the forseeable future” to avoid disruption to patient care but will no longer have a dedicated salesforce, resulting in 130 job losses. The changes are expected to result in charges of $65m. Indivior said it had reached an $85m settlement with health Care Service of Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and others to resolve anti-trust litigation in Roanoke County Circuit Court in Virgina, pending since 2020. Last year, Indivior, and its former parent company, the consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, from which it was spun off in 2014, faced a lawsuit in London’s high court over allegedly false marketing of Suboxone, but the case was thrown out in December. The US justice department in 2019 charged Indivior with fraudulently claiming Suboxone film was better and safer than similar drugs. Reckitt agreed to pay a $1.4bn fine to settle the case in July 2019, without any admission of wrongdoing, while Indivior said in 2020 that it had “pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement relating to healthcare matters in 2012” and that it would “make payments to federal and state authorities totalling $600m over a period of seven years”. Shaun Thaxter, the former Indivior chief executive, was sentenced to six months in federal prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to his role in a scheme to secure Medicaid coverage for Suboxone film by misleading officials about its dangers to children. Thaxter was replaced by Crossley, the former chief financial and operations officer, who has worked at the company since 2017.     8.32am BST  Thames Water 'pollutions' increase 6%  Thames Water’s financial situation is shocking, but its political impact has partly been caused by the disgusting facts of what happens when things go wrong: raw sewage flowing into the UK’s rivers. The company on Tuesday said that the number of “pollutions” in the year to March 2024 had increased to 350, compared to 331 in the previous year. That is a 6% increase. Thames Water said that was “driven by a 40% increase in average rainfall” and that “The number of serious pollutions decreased by 18%”.     8.27am BST   Responding to Thames Water’s annual results, Paul de Zylva, senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, an environmental campaign group, said:  Water companies have had free license to line their shareholders’ pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble. Failed regulation has allowed Thames Water’s past and present owners to extract money, and to burden the company with debts running at over £19bn. It’s staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems onto its customers – asking Ofwat to allow it increase bills by a shocking 59%. This means bill payers being left to subsidise what little it’s prepared to invest towards fixing the pollution and sewage scandal. The regulator must end this license for water companies to profit from pollution, while wildlife and our health is put at risk. Proper regulation means Ofwat must make Thames Water and other water companies pay for the clean-up needed without passing on higher bills to us. It also means proper fines for polluting and an end to water bosses getting high pay and bonuses for failure.      8.16am BST  Vistry Group says it will increase housebuilding this year  Vistry Group, the house builder formerly known as Boris Homes, expects to build more than 18,000 homes this year, up nearly 12% from last year, as it prepares to work with Keir Starmer’s government to tackle the UK’s housing crisis. Greg Fitzgerald, the chief executive, said:  We look forward to working with the new government to address the country’s housing crisis and are extremely well placed to support its ambition of delivering the biggest boost to affordable housing in a generation.  Housebuilding shares jumped on news of the landslide Labour victory last Friday, as the party has pledged to tackle planning issues and build 1.5m homes in the next five years. Vistry expects to make an adjusted profit before tax of £186m in the first six months of the year, up 7%, with completions rising by 8% to 7,750 homes. It sad it had benefited from lower building material costs compared with last year. Vistry’s share price rose by 0.6%. The Kent-based company works with local authorities, housing associations and private rental firms to deliver affordable housing. Those partnerships are set to fund 75% of all completions this year. Vistry has seen a pick-up in demand from the private rented sector, while traditional registered providers of social housing are currently focusing on maintenance and remediation of existing housing, particularly in London. In May, Vistry sold a further 1,750 homes to the private rental company Leaf Living, which was set up in 2021 by Regis and the US fund manager Blackstone. Most of the homes are expected to complete within the next couple of years. RBC Capital Markets analyst Anthony Codling said:  The election of Labour is good news for Vistry. With its focus on build rates and partnership homes, it is likely to become the teacher’s pet of the Labour government. Working closely with local authorities could provide a win-win, helping councils meet their housing needs, the government its housing targets, and delivering more choice to renters and homebuyers.  Investec’s housing analyst Aynsley Lammin concurred, saying:  The partnerships model continues to underpin a relatively strong performance against a weak private open market … The open market still looks constrained, but with some positive momentum and firm pricing with sales incentives continuing.

Thames Water has said that it has enough cash to keep it going until May 2025, as potential investors await the outcome of negotiation with the UK regulator. The company, which provides water to London and the Thames Valley in the south-east of England, is in a parlous financial state. Keir Starmer, the new prime minister, and Rachel Reeves, the new chancellor, have been briefed that the company presents a “critical risk” to the country. Thames Water Utilities Limited, the regulated subsidiary, on Tuesday said it had £1.8bn in cash and other liquid assets “sufficient to fund our operations for the next 11 months to the end of May 2025”.  Following the draft determination and our response to Ofwat we will be engaging with potential investors and creditors to seek new equity and to extend our liquidity runway. Any equity process is not expected to conclude until after the final determination.  The company reported a 10% increase in revenues to £2.4bn in the year to 31 March as it raised bills in line with inflation, and scraped to a profit of £75m. It also said that it spent a record £2.1bn as it maintained and upgraded its ageing pipe network. Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water since December, said he believed the business could be turned around. He said:  The challenges we face are well documented, but our operational and financial performance for the last year show good progress, and these positive results provide the right foundations on which to build and improve.  Japan’s Nikkei index hits new record Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed at a new record high on Tuesday, the latest in a series of records amid a global surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence companies. Computer chip semiconductor companies – who have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the rally – helped the index to a 2% gain on Tuesday, outpacing other Asian stock indices. The index closed at a record high of 41,580.17 on Tuesday, after rising as high as 41,769.35 during afternoon trading. The Nikkei had taken decades to surpass its previous peak, hit during the 1989 bubble. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87; that level was reached again in February, 34 years later.  \n",
      "Neil Sebba, the managing director of healthy eating chain Tossed, does not take long when asked if he is a risk-taker. “Yes: who buys a brand in Covid in a market that is completely dead?” he says, reflecting on the decision he and co-owner Angelina Harrisson took to buy the business out of administration in September 2020. Sitting in Tossed’s Victoria Street branch in central London during the lunchtime rush, Sebba tucks into a cauliflower and harissa salad, a combination to which he says he has become addicted. The shop is the picture of a modern food outlet. Dance music is pumped through the brightly lit interior while customers choose their custom-made salads or wraps on touchscreens, which offer nutritional information on every choice. It is a scene that looked impossible four years ago, when Tossed nearly vanished completely. A casualty of Covid-19, the chain relied on the lunchtime office market, which was wiped out by lockdowns. Within months of the coronavirus outbreak, it had plunged into administration, closing its 14 stores and letting 260 employees go. “Effectively, the music stopped, and you are thinking, do we have enough chairs to sit on?” he says. “I had to see if the business was viable, and then make everyone redundant and put the business into administration.” It proved a defining moment for Sebba, who joined Tossed in 2010, five years after it was founded by the entrepreneur Vincent McKevitt. His childhood was a world away from Tossed’s busy central London heartland: he grew up near the Suffolk village of Nayland. But trips to work with his father, the managing director of a property company, gave him a glimpse of City life, and he set his sights on a career in finance while at Warwick University. After six years at accountancy firm BDO, he joined Cornerstone Corporate Finance, where he spent four years raising money for hospitality businesses, including Wagamama. “It frustrated me: you kept helping businesses to write up plans but never got to help them to carry them out,” Sebba says. Disillusioned, he took the biggest risk of his life. Months away from his wedding, he wrote to McKevitt, unsolicited, to offer his services. He resigned from Cornerstone and worked for nothing to raise money for Tossed on the proviso that he would be made finance director if successful.   Everybody is on furlough and you become very isolated; it was very lonely. It’s hard not to feel responsible   During Sebba’s nine years in charge of the numbers, after he’d raised the money, Tossed grew to 32 stores, including franchised outlets, across the UK, and two in Dubai. With Harrisson, he in effect began running the business.  And then Covid hit. “It’s a weird situation. Everybody is on furlough and you become very isolated; it was very lonely,” he says. “It’s hard not to feel responsible, even though you clearly have no control over Covid, but you have people looking to you for answers.” Tossed was not alone. Analysis from PwC in 2021 found that 17,500 chain store outlets disappeared as a direct result of Covid-19.Sebba was determined that the Tossed brand would survive. He called Harrisson, who is now brand director, and suggested a relaunch. The pair delved into their contacts books to raise £500,000, renegotiated leases and opened five shops in September 2020. “We made the decision when there wasn’t even a vaccine: we were shooting blind,” he says. By that winter, with the virus rampant, the pair doubled down, hunting for more shops. “Snow was covering London and I was walking around the city looking for new stores, with not a single other person around. It was like a 28 Days Later scenario,” he says. The gamble paid off. Tossed now has 13 shops across London, offering salads marketed as “gym food”, hot curries and “big fat Greek” yoghurts. But Sebba is keen to stress the different environment it now operates in. First, the move towards hybrid working has meant that there are many fewer people travelling into the city, particularly on Mondays and Fridays. Sebba pulls across his laptop to call up the latest Transport for London data, which shows that, on 21 June, the number of Friday tube journeys was 3.56m, down from 4.54m on the same date in 2019. “We’ve got fewer purchasing opportunities and you are basically trading on three and a half days a week,” says Sebba.  He adds that there is some evidence that commuters are willing to spend more than before on the days they travel in. However, the cost of living crisis has necessitated putting more affordable options on to menus: non-customised salads and wraps costing about £6 now sit alongside its typical salads, which are priced just under £10. Meanwhile, costs have kept pressure on its balance sheet. “You’ve got inflationary pressure coming from food costs, inflation, living wage rates and the electric,” he says. With footfall down, Sebba has built up Tossed’s deliveries business, which includes a kitchen in Canary Wharf. He says this market has also been bolstered by companies offering lunch to employees as a perk to get them to come into the office. To help make the business more efficient, Tossed now uses the platform Stint to hire casual staff for brief periods to match footfall. Stint works by offering people short shifts of two hours and more at retailers. In busy periods, when Tossed stores require 12 staff simultaneously, a third of these could be recruited through the app.  “It’s allowing us to marry labour resources better with demand,” says Sebba. “Without it, you’d be hard pushed to make the economics work, because of the way people are buying less frequently during the week.” With Sebba’s changes, the economics are starting to work. It expects to be profitable this year for the first time since it went bust, after recording a £500,000 loss last year. Revenues are expected to hit more than £9m, up from £7.4m last year. Sebba has his eyes on branching outside the central London lunch trade. “Our initial plan was to capture the core central London market and get the best locations we could,” he says. “We are now looking at other opportunities and types of location, whether it is travel, tourism or food courts, something different to explore.” Given his record, don’t bet against him making this gamble work.

      "BP is preparing to take a hit of almost $3bn (£2.3bn) in its results for April to June as lower demand for fuels leads to woes within the company’s oil refining business. The oil supermajor warned investors that “significantly lower realised refining margins” could wipe between $500m and $700m from its earnings for the quarter. It also expects to take a $2bn writedown resulting from a plan to scale back its refining operations at its Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany by a third from next year in response to weaker demand.   Related: Thames Water criticised as profits and pollution rise – business live   The looming financial hit comes amid wider pressures facing the global refining business. The US oil company ExxonMobil warned investors this week that lower refining margins would have a negative impact on second-quarter profit of between $1.1bn and $1.5bn. BP added that its oil trading business was “expected to be weak”, while gas trading was expected to be “average”. The update caused BP shares to drop by more than 3.5% to 457.76p a share on Tuesday morning. On Monday it was reported that the company’s ousted former chief executive, Bernard Looney, had met senior figures in the United Arab Emirates in the hopes of securing private equity investment to fund a new oil venture. Looney was sacked from the company last year for failing to disclose his relationships with colleagues to the board. The Irishman had reportedly held talks with Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and with Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser and businessman, according to the Financial Times. Looney is not understood to be in talks with the UAE’s state oil company, Adnoc. The British oil and gas multinational Shell is also expected to take an impairment charge of up to $2bn in its next set of results after it was forced to halt work on Europe’s largest sustainable aviation fuel project in Rotterdam and sell off a Singapore refinery. The company plans to pull back on investments through its low-carbon division in favour of investment in growing its gas business. It said on Tuesday that it would move ahead with plans to develop a gas field east of Trinidad and Tobago. \n",
      "Sewage pollution from ageing Thames Water treatment works that have not been upgraded increased last year, causing the company to again fail to meet its legal targets, according to its financial report. Across the Thames Water area, the number of incidents of pollution from treatment works and the pipe network increased to 350, compared with 331 in 2022. The rise was attributed to delays in investment to create more capacity at many of the company’s 400 ageing sewage treatment works. Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said the works could not cope with a 40% increase in rainfall and exceptionally high levels of groundwater. Asked why Thames had failed for many years to invest in upgrading treatment works, Weston repeated that the works were “old”. He said: “They require a lot of development, a lot of investment into things like putting in storm tanks. All of that takes time and requires a lot of investment on top of what we have done already.” The company said there had been a “significant increase in sewage treatment works pollutions” in the year, caused by delays to pollution improvement engineering programmes, as well as the installation of more monitoring at works. The need for improvements at the huge treatment works at Mogden in south-west London, and delayed works to increase capacity at treatment works in Witney in Oxfordshire, Chesham in Buckinghamshire, and Fairford in Gloucestershire were given as reasons for the rise in pollution incidents. Campaigners in these areas have raised concerns for many years about pollution into rivers from the treatment works. In March, sewage was pumped into the River Chess from the Chesham treatment works for more than 800 hours over more than a month. Thames Water admitted the works had “a history of prolonged storm discharges”. Weston said: “Pollutions are a massive area of focus for Thames. We deal with over 5bn litres of sewage of waste every day. All of that has to be treated through sewage treatment works. People in Thames Water go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the network is functioning as it should and do all they can to avoid pollution. “Rain has a huge impact on spills. Our sewage treatment works can only take a certain capacity and we have to protect them. When we get adverse rainfall as we did in February, it is a volume that our treatment works were never designed to cope with.” Thames Water is at the centre of an Ofwat investigation into widespread illegal sewage dumping across its treatment works and faces huge fines. The Environment Agency is conducting a criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping from its network. In its business plan to 2030, which has been submitted to Ofwat, the company is seeking to be treated differently from all other water companies and face lower fines for polluting rivers, as it attempts to stay afloat. Thames, which has debts of almost £15bn, wants to be allowed to raise bills by 59% to pay for investment in infrastructure, as well as paying out higher dividends to its shareholders. The company has admitted it has been sweating assets for many years and said bills needed to rise to pay for the investment. Ofwat is due to make a draft determination on the business plan on Thursday. Weston said one of the reasons the company was putting forward a plan with significant investment was to tackle its ageing treatment works. Paul de Zylva, a senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: “Water companies have had free licence to line their shareholders’ pockets handsomely for decades while letting our rivers and seas fill with sewage and infrastructure crumble. “It’s staggering that the company is still counting on weak regulation to allow it to survive by pushing its problems on to its customers – asking Ofwat to allow it to increase bills by a shocking 59%. This means bill payers being left to subsidise what little it’s prepared to invest towards fixing the pollution and sewage scandal.

      "Thames Water said it intended to tap investors for fresh funds as it would run out of money by next June without a cash injection, raising fears over its potential collapse. The debt-laden company, which has faced sustained criticism over sewage dumps, leaky pipes and extracted dividends, said it had £1.8bn, “sufficient to fund our operations for the next 11 months to the end of May 2025”. In financial results for the year to 31 March, Thames said revenues rose 10% to £2.4bn as a result of “inflation linked” increases in the amount it charged for water and wastewater services. Profits jumped 21% driven by higher revenues and “cost discipline”.   Related: Poor state of Thames Water a ‘critical risk’ to UK, Starmer and Reeves told   Thames has £15.2bn of debt, up £1.3bn on the previous year, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse if the government stepped in to renationalise the troubled company. The Guardian revealed in April a contingency plan was being drawn up in Whitehall to renationalise Britain’s biggest water company if it collapses. Thames said it was “reasonable” to assume it would have sufficient resources to continue operating until at least April 2025, but there were “material uncertainties”. These included not securing commitments for future funding, a downgrade to its credit rating or a failure to meet its legal obligations, which could trigger a default on its debts.  Interactive  The situation is so severe that the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames presents a “critical risk” to the country during their first few days in office. Chris Weston, the chief executive of Thames who joined in January, said the company could still find a solution in the financial markets without need for government intervention, depending on decisions by its regulator, Ofwat. He added that a temporary nationalisation “is something that is not in the interests of any of our stakeholders or the UK taxpayer. “I can’t put any probability on whether it will or won’t happen, but it is a long way off if it were to happen. There is a lot more that we can do … to make sure that does not happen.” Weston said “it is extremely early days”, but the company has been in touch with the new government and would have discussions “as appropriate” in the near future. On Thursday, Ofwat will give its first view on five-year business plans submitted last year by English and Welsh water companies, including Thames.  Interactive  Thames intended to contact potential investors after Ofwat’s documents had been published. Weston said a “broach church” of investors would be approached, with a formal process beginning in autumn and expected to stretch into 2025. The Ofwat review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills – which the company wants to increase by 59% - and whether its £19.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved. The company, which serves 16 million customers in the London and Thames valley regions, said it was working on the basis that an injection of new equity was “possible” but “should no longer be assumed”. The number of pollution incidents increased to 350 last year, up on 331 in 2022, which Thames said was driven by a deluge of higher than average rainfall. “It is a volume that our networks were never designed to cope with,” Weston said. The slow-burn crisis at Thames Water stepped up in March, when it said shareholders – which include the pension funds USS and Omers – had U-turned on £500m of promised funding, claiming Ofwat had made the company “uninvestable”. Its parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt in April. The Guardian has since revealed that Thames’s board approved a £150m dividend just hours before the announcement and Ofwat is studying the payout. Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: “Thames operating profits have improved so now is the time for its shareholders to back the company the equity required to cut leakage and sewage spills. “The shareholders are starving Thames of the cash required to keep ageing assets going.” Paul de Zylva, the senior sustainability analyst at Friends of the Earth, said: “Proper regulation means Ofwat must make Thames Water and other water companies pay for the clean-up needed without passing on higher bills to us. It also means proper fines for polluting and an end to water bosses getting high pay and bonuses for failure.” Thames’s annual report showed Weston picked up £437,000 for his first few months in the job, including a £195,000 bonus. His predecessor, Sarah Bentley – who resigned abruptly in June 2023 – received £436,429 during her notice period.\n",
      "UK retail sales slumped last month as cold weather deterred shoppers from buying summer clothing and gardening supplies, despite pressure easing on households amid a slowdown of inflation. The latest snapshot from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% drop in total UK retail sales compared against June last year. Highlighting the pressure on retailers amid a wider slowdown in spending as households grapple with the cost of living crisis, the trade body blamed the drop on unseasonably cold weather. “Retail sales performed poorly in June as the cooler weather during the first half of the month dulled consumer spending,” said the BRC’s chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Sales of weather-sensitive categories such as clothing and footwear, as well as DIY and gardening were hit particularly hard, especially compared to the surge in spending during last June’s heatwave.” The gloomy consumer outlook comes as high Bank of England interest rates continue to weigh on household spending power. While inflation has returned to the 2% target set by the government, prices still remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold. Separate figures from Barclays also released on Tuesday showed card spending fell 0.6% in June, the first decline since February 2021, as cold weather sapped consumer demand and forced some fashion brands to adjust their sales schedules. However, it said entertainment had remained a staple among Britons, with strong growth in spending on pub visits, takeaways and digital streaming services. Experts said some of the sales weakness could be explained by the year-on-year comparison with June 2023, when sales had been particularly strong. Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the data provider IGD, said hot weather in the final week of June this year helped to boost spending. “While the election campaign has not impacted shopper confidence during June, we might expect to see a boost following the election. We have seen a positive bump for shopper confidence immediately following the three previous general elections, therefore we should expect something similar as we move through July,” she added. The BRC said it expected retail sales to bounce back over the coming months, helped by the men’s Euro 2024 tournament.  “Electronics sales had a better month as football fans cheering on their national teams upgraded their home entertainment systems and people replaced their pandemic purchases,” she added. “Retailers remain hopeful that as the summer social season gets into full swing and the weather improves, sales will follow suit.” \n",
      "By the end of the decade, well over 60m heat pumps could be warming homes across Europe, according to industry figures, as government policies target household carbon emissions. In the UK, the newly appointed energy and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband, has committed to maintaining the heat pump grants offered by the previous government to help to accelerate the rollout of the technology.  The total effect of this switch away from fossil fuel heating to low-carbon alternatives could cut CO2 emissions across Europe by 46%, but critics of the technology point to another cumulative impact: noise. Heat pumps are designed to be installed outside the home to extract warmth from the air, ground or water. In densely populated areas, this could mean scores of heat pump fans humming within a small area. One device typically emits a constant hum of between 40 and 60 decibels – about the same as a fridge or dishwasher – but could millions of heat pumps amount to a noise nuisance? The claim Concerns about heat pump noise began to take hold in the British press late last year after the Conservative government commissioned an independent review into noise emissions from air source heat pumps. Research submitted included a report by three experts presented at the Institute of Acoustics conference last October. It was seized on by the Daily Telegraph, which reported that it had found heat pumps were “too noisy for millions of homes in the UK”. The report contained a claim that heat pumps installed in flats or terraced houses would break the noise limits set by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), an accreditation body, which stipulate that a heat pump should be no louder than 42 decibels within one metre of a neighbour’s door or window. The Daily Mail and Daily Express repeated the story a day later. Concerns about the issue appeared in the Guardian, too, with one reader’s letter complaining that a summer stay in a development where all eight properties had heat pumps was marred by the devices. “If you sat in the garden in the evening, it was an annoying, continual source of noise,” the writer said. The science The main source of heat pump noise is the fan, which draws in air, and the compressor, which raises the temperature of the refrigerant by increasing pressure on its gases. (You can read more about exactly how a heat pump works here.) Typically an air source heat pump will run at a decibel level of about 40, but it can reach 60 on particularly cold days when it needs to work harder to draw extra heat from the air. This would put it in a similar noise range as a fridge – or a gas boiler. Older devices have typically been noisier than the latest ones. Some manufacturers produce low-noise heat pumps, which sacrifice a little in terms of efficiency to offer a quieter experience. The Guardian reader’s experience may have been due to improper installation or the use of older, noisier heat pump models, according to Jack Harvie-Clark, a director at Apex Acoustics. “Modern heat pumps can be significantly quieter, and proper placement – away from property boundaries – can further reduce noise impact,” he said. Apex was one of the consultancies behind the report cited by the Telegraph. It was quick to rebuff the coverage, describing its “misleading” claims that heat pumps were too noisy for millions of UK homes as “an exaggeration”. “While noise is a valid concern … technology improvements and proper installation can mitigate noise issues in most homes. The article presents noise as an insurmountable problem, which is not the case,” the company said, pointing out that there were many homes – typically detached and semi-detached properties – where there would be no problem at all. Last November the UK government published the results of its review, which found that noise emissions were a concern for a minority of consumers, with a low incidence of complaints. In the chancellor’s autumn statement later that month, it was announced that the government would consult on changing rules that apply in England, including removing the one-metre boundary rule. The government’s research included a survey of households living within 50 metres of a heat pump, across 60 areas with high heat pump uptake, to gauge noise nuisance inside the house. It asked respondents to specify which neighbourhood noises could be heard from indoors. Heat pumps received one of the lowest number of mentions, while dogs topped the list. The study found that 57% of the 139 respondents noticed barking during the day, and just 4% noticed the sound of a heat pump. Harvie-Clark has done further research on the issue for Nesta, an innovation charity, which is due to be published this month. Its findings suggest that even in worst-case scenarios with high housing density and all air source heat pumps operating simultaneously at maximum permitted sound power levels, the cumulative noise impact was not likely to be more significant than the individual noise impact of the nearest neighbour’s heat pump. “I’ve also investigated in detail how some other European countries manage noise from air source heat pumps,” Harvie-Clark said. “Most have higher noise limits in the daytime and some, but not all, have slightly lower limits in the night-time. “We [in the UK] have one noise level limit for all times, which to me seems clumsy. The main manufacturers see northern Europe as one market, so they all have controls that can limit operation to lower noise levels at night-time The caveats Although potential noise issues can be mitigated, Harvie-Clark believes that more work should be done to understand the impact of heat pumps as they gain popularity across Europe, and he has stressed that consumer education is key to ensuring that the right heat pump is installed in the right way. For example, the government’s review of whether heat pump noise is noticeable has some notable limitations: heat pumps are not widely used, so even an area of “high density” will include fewer heat pumps than there will be in the future. There are other issues with the way noise limits are characterised. For example, a heat pump’s defrost cycle, which is louder than its normal running level, is not included in MCS’s noise tests. “Nor is low-frequency noise, nor any information on tonality or directionality,” said Harvie-Clark. “So these things cannot by definition be taken into account in any calculation or assessment prior to installation.” The verdict Heat pumps are quieter than they used to be, and getting quieter still. But better consumer information could go further in mitigating the overall impact of noise by choosing the best model for the home and using it correctly. “I believe that many people in the UK try to operate their heat pumps the way they operate gas boilers – turning them on and off – but they can’t heat houses as quickly as gas boilers, so they need to run constantly to do that,” said Harvie-Clark. Turning heat pumps on after a period of being off will require the machine to work harder and therefore create more noise. So taking a slow and steady approach to home heating can make heat pumps more efficient, and quieter, too. “In colder European countries they accept that this is how to run heating systems. Our temperate climate means people have different control expectations,” Harvie-Clark said. “While the potential noise impact of air source heat pumps should be considered, it is important to balance this with the significant environmental benefits of transitioning away from fossil fuel heating systems. Gas boilers also make a noise.”\n",
      "A United Airlines jet lost a landing-gear wheel during take off from Los Angeles, but was able to land safely in Denver, its planned destination, with no injuries, the airline said. “The wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event,” United said in a statement on Monday. It was the second such incident for the airline this year.   Related: ‘They can’t move on’: families of Boeing crash victims demand justice   The aircraft involved in Monday’s incident was a nearly 30-year-old Boeing 757-200, according to FlightRadar24 data, which was carrying 174 passengers and 7 crew members. Boeing ended production of the 757 in 2004. In March, a United Airlines Boeing 777-200 jet headed for Japan lost a tire mid-air after takeoff from San Francisco, landing safely at Los Angeles International Airport. The wheel landed on a car in an airport employee parking lot, breaking a car window, but no one was hurt. Monday’s incident was the latest in a string of incidents involving United Airlines planes. One aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles international airport in March due to an issue with its hydraulic system. Elsewhere that month, another flight was attempting to land in Houston when it rolled off the taxiway and into the grass. Also in March, a flight carrying 167 passengers made an emergency landing in Houston, after bright flames burst out of the engine of the United flight 1118, a Boeing 737-900 en route from Houston to Fort Myers, Florida. US flight issues were catapulted into the headline in January, after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 in mid-air, shortly after it took off from Portland Oregon, forcing it to make an emergency landing. Several people were injured. In April, United Airlines blamed a $200m (£161m) hit to its earnings in the first three months of the year on the incident, saying the mid-flight blowout on rival Alaska airlines forced it to ground many of its Boeing planes, contributing to the losses.

      "The prime minister and chancellor have been briefed by Whitehall officials that the poor state of Thames Water presents a “critical risk” to the country, the Guardian understands. Fears about the company go beyond its precarious financial position and include the management of sites that provide drinking water and sewage treatment for millions of customers across the capital and the Thames valley. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were first to be briefed on the issue. They were warned by civil servants that the dire state of Thames’s infrastructure is one of the most urgent problems facing the new government, according to sources. The condition of Coppermills, a vast water treatment works in north-east London that serves as many as 3 million people, is particularly alarming, ministers and aides have been told. The site is classed among the UK’s most important pieces of national infrastructure. A financial update on Tuesday is due to reveal more about the frayed finances of Britain’s biggest water company. Thames’s annual results will be followed on Thursday by an initial verdict from the water watchdog Ofwat on water companies’ five-year spending plans and bill increases. Thames was among a list of “critical risks” that require urgent attention, with its potential financial collapse considered a potential “major threat to critical national infrastructure”, according to briefings given to the prime minister and chancellor. Management failings have added to fears of potential “widespread disruption to essential services” caused by crumbling infrastructure, it is understood. It has been reported that the ailing water company is among the top priorities of the prime minister’s chief of staff, Sue Gray. On Monday, the PM’s spokesperson suggested that the government would prefer not to nationalise the company, saying it doesn’t “think it’s the right course of action”. They added: “Instead, the government’s focused on holding these companies to account, ensuring they’re investing and improving our systems rather than rewarding themselves.” Nevertheless, the government will have no choice but to move to safeguard London’s water supply should Thames’s finances fail. Thames is the most indebted of the UK’s water monopolies and is labouring under a £15.6bn debt pile. Its finances have been left threadbare after previous shareholders, led by the Australian bank Macquarie, siphoned out billions of pounds of dividends and it was fined for pollution and leaks. Emergency plans drawn up by Whitehall and seen by the Guardian would turn the company into a publicly owned arm’s-length body under the state’s special administration regime. This would ensure that it can continue to provide water and sewage treatment services to its 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley. Thames is burning through its cash reserves as it struggles to attract new investment. Last month it was revealed by the Guardian that the company agreed to pay a £150m dividend in late March – hours before its existing shareholders U-turned on providing £500m of emergency funding. Concerns about its future rest not only on its financial position. Officials are fearful of the ability of the company to make and manage essential improvements to is creaking operations and infrastructure. In a sign of how serious concerns about its future are, the debate is being weighed at No 10 and 11, rather than solely at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been working on rescue plans with the Treasury. A spokesperson for Defra said: “We are closely monitoring the situation and the company remains stable.” A source close to Steve Reed, the newly appointed Defra secretary of state, said: “We are in this situation because of 14 years of Conservative incompetence. The Conservatives weakened regulation, allowing water companies to get into debt while the sewage system crumbled and illegal sewage-dumping hit record levels.”They added: “The election of this Labour government is a reset moment for the water industry. Over the coming weeks and months, this government will outline its first steps to reform the water sector.” Plans for Thames’s nationalisation would in effect pull it on to the government’s balance sheet. Investors would be likely to face steep losses on loans made to the company. Thames Water declined to comment. A spokesperson for Ofwat declined to comment on specific briefings. They said in a statement: “Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by shareholders of Thames Water. We will publish our view of its business plan for the 2025-2030 period on 11 July, along with all other water companies, as part of our PR24 proposals. Thames Water must continue to pursue all options to seek further equity to fund its turnaround plan for the benefit of customers and the environment.”\n",
      "A senior Bank of England policymaker has said Britain’s battle against inflation remains incomplete, requiring interest rates to be kept at elevated levels for longer than expected in financial markets. Pouring cold water on City predictions for a cut in rates in August, Jonathan Haskel said inflation was on course to return above the government’s 2% target. “I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,” said Haskel, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), in a speech at King’s College London on Monday. While adding there were “encouraging signs” in the battle against fast-rising prices after a drop in the headline rate of consumer price inflation to 2% in May, he warned that the return to the official target set by the government would be temporary amid pressures from a tight jobs market. “The playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time,” he said. Financial markets currently estimate there is a 60% chance the Bank will cut interest rates on 1 August for the first time since the Covid pandemic. While some members of the Bank’s nine-strong MPC have pushed for a cut in official borrowing costs over recent months, Haskel has voted to keep rates on hold. The economist, who will complete his term on the MPC at the end of August, has previously expressed caution over cutting rates, as one of the more hawkish members of the rate-setting panel. The appointment of his successor will fall to the new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as one of her first tasks in government. In the first speech by one of the Bank’s policymakers since the general election, Haskel said the lingering impact from soaring energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had been “sufficient to impart momentum to current inflation”. UK inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022. “The labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably,” he said.   Related: Bank of England keeps interest rates at 5.25% in ‘finely balanced’ decision   Rishi Sunak had argued before last week’s election that “difficult decisions” taken by his Conservative government had helped the economy “turn a corner”, making a pitch to the electorate that a vote for the Tories was a vote for lower interest rates. The former prime minister called the general election in May after official figures confirmed inflation had dropped to 2.3% in April, amid hopes in Tory circles that the Bank would cut interest rates in June, before the ballot. However, the central bank kept rates unchanged at 5.25% last month, having consistently warned that inflation was likely to rise later this year, amid pressure from rising prices in the service sector and resilient wage growth. Having shifted his party to the economic centre, Keir Starmer argued that Labour would bring stability to policymaking after years of turmoil under the Conservatives and boost economic growth as a result.\n",
      "Paul Kiernan struggles to talk about what happened on 10 March 2019. He walked his partner, Joanna Toole, to a taxi, put her bag in the back and kissed her goodbye. He told her he loved her, and asked her to let him know when she landed safely. The message never came. Toole’s flight, Ethiopian Airlines 302, crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa killing all 157 people on board. It was the second fatal disaster involving a Boeing 737 Max jet in less than five months. On 29 October 2018, Lion Air flight 610 crashed minutes after taking off from Jakarta. All 189 people on board died.   Related: Boeing will plead guilty to criminal fraud over 737 Max crashes   “For others, I guess they read it and see it as a business story, or something,” Kiernan said. “But for us, it’s a very personal thing.” Boeing did what beleaguered companies so often do when they want to repair a battered reputation: ousted its boss, reassured the regulators and attempted to draw a line under the matter. All the while, hundreds of families whose loved ones lost their lives awaited justice. Five years later, and even after this announcement, many feel they are still waiting. The Max disasters seemed to be fading in the public and political arena until this year, when Boeing again came under intense scrutiny after a cabin panel blew off a brand-new 737 Max, minutes after taking off from Portland, Oregon. The incident reignited questions about the aerospace giant’s management, production line and the fundamental safety of its planes. It is “the luck of God”, according to Kiernan, that a third fatal crash was avoided. As Boeing grappled with another safety crisis and scrambled to reassure alarmed regulators, furious airlines and anxious passengers, the Department of Justice (DoJ) reconsidered a controversial agreement it struck in 2021. The agreement, which was branded a “sweetheart deal” by victims’ families, protected Boeing from a criminal conspiracy charge tied to the two Max crashes – and avoided a trial – provided the planemaker overhaul its compliance program and pay $2.5bn, including compensation and a criminal fine of $243.6m. “The families felt like they were completely brushed aside and ignored by the government: the very people they trusted to do the right thing, and hold Boeing to account,” according to Erin Applebaum, attorney at Kreindler & Kreindler, who represents some of those who had loved ones on board the Ethiopian flight, including Kiernan. The justice department signaled it was willing to change course in May, however, when it declared that Boeing had breached the 2021 deal. Its conclusion was welcomed by victims’ families, who demanded that the company be criminally prosecuted, after all. But when officials informed the relatives of their plan late last month, it proved another bitter blow. While Boeing will be charged with fraud, the company was offered a plea agreement by the justice department, again enabling it to avoid trial. Provided the deal is approved by the US district judge Reed O’Connor in Texas, Boeing would have to pay a fine of up to $487.2m, although this may be lowered if the judge takes account of the previous fine; spend “at least” $455m on compliance and safety programs; and work under an independent compliance monitor to scrutinize its actions for three years. “This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing’s conspiracy, 346 people died,” said Paul Cassell, an attorney representing some of the relatives. “Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DoJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing’s crime are being hidden.” Under the agreement, Boeing’s board of directors would also have to meet with the grieving families of those who died. Above all, many of the victims’ relatives want accountability they feel has yet to materialize. Boeing’s public response to January’s panel blowout has only heightened their anger. Kiernan contrasted his struggle to find the words with the “practiced apology” delivered by Dave Calhoun on Capitol Hill. Before a tense Senate hearing in June, the Boeing CEO turned to relatives of the crash victims and said he was sorry for their “gut-wrenching” losses. “By the way he’s saying it, you know he doesn’t understand, or that he doesn’t mean it,” said Kiernan. A matter of minutes later, he noted, Calhoun told senators he was “proud of every action” Boeing had taken on safety.   We should not be surprised at the door, the mis-drilled holes, the whistleblowers. That is the result of 20 years of focusing on financial performance over safety  Javier de Luis    In the spring, Brian West, Boeing’s chief financial officer, described how the company had for years prioritized moving planes through factories over getting it done right. “That’s got to change,” he told a conference. “The leadership team got it in the immediate aftermath of January 5.” The comment stung Javier de Luis. “I would have thought that they would have ‘gotten it’ five years ago,” the aerospace engineer told senators in April. His sister, Graziella, was on Ethiopian flight 302. “I was just flabbergasted after I saw that quote,” Javier said. “The two crashes should have been a notice to clean house, to wipe the slate clean, to figure out how to get back to the company they used to be. It doesn’t seem to have registered five years ago, and honestly, it remains to be seen whether that registers now.” The world “should not be surprised” by Boeing’s latest crisis, he added. “We should not be surprised at the door, the mis-drilled holes, the whistleblowers. That is the result of 20 years of focusing on financial performance over safety.” A string of whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of safety and quality issues, and claims they were ignored, marginalized and even threatened for raising the alarm internally. Boeing has insisted some allegations about its 787 Dreamliner and 777 jets are “inaccurate”, and claimed employees have been emboldened in recent months to speak up with safety and quality concerns. Kiernan knows who he trusts. “Which one do I believe – all of these whistleblowers that have nothing to gain from any of this, but are stepping out and are saying that there are major problems in the company? Or do I believe this guy [Calhoun] who’s getting paid $33m, a 45% increase in his salary from last year, and that has everything to lose from this thing going wrong? Who is more likely to be lying?” The panel flew off an Alaska Airlines flight in January almost exactly three years after Boeing “promised to make all of these safety changes” as part of its first agreement with the justice department, Kiernan observed. “All of those people could have died.” Applebaum, the attorney, could scarcely believe one headline describing the justice department’s “wrenching” decision over whether to prosecute Boeing. “Do you know who has to make a wrenching decision every day? It’s these families – to make the decision to get out of bed, and keep fighting for the people they lost instead of trying to put things in the past and move on.” While January’s cabin blowout reignited media interest in Boeing, and jolted regulators into action, the relatives have been “beating this drum” for five long years, Applebaum noted. “Do you know how hard it is to relive the worst day of your life over and over and over? Every time they come to Washington, and every time they come to Texas, and every time they do an interview, they have to relive those days over again. “They have to hold pictures of the people they lost. I mean, they can’t move on while this is happening. But they’re doing it because it’s so important to them to get justice for their loved ones, and to make sure this doesn’t happen to anybody ever again.”\n",
      "What was it that Ian Durant, chairman of Britvic, the Fruit Shoot, J20 and R White’s lemonade firm, was saying about Carlsberg’s last bid at £3.1bn, or £12.50 a share? Here it is: the offer “significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects”. What he really meant, it turns out, is that the Danes were offering close to fair value and Britvic’s board would roll over for a bump of a mere 5% in price. So it was that Carlsberg’s improvement to £13.15, or £3.3bn, was accompanied by a fine display of verbal gymnastics from the Britvic boardroom on Monday. The new bid offers “compelling” strategic logic plus the certainty of cash for shareholders, said Durant. The modestly superior new terms reflect the “the current strength and medium-term prospects”. This column would have preferred Britvic to have held out for some fizz – £14 a share, say – because the company is doing OK under its own steam. Having weathered a stay-at-home pandemic and a bout of inflation in packaging costs, recent trading has been strong and share buy-backs have been arriving regularly and confidently. Surrendering for a 36% takeover premium is nothing special in today’s undervalued (or so the fund managers keep telling us) UK stock market. Britvic’s directors would have a plea in mitigation, it should be said, and it has some weight. It is the fact that the power beyond their throne is PepsiCo. Half Britivic’s revenues come from bottling its drinks under licence – think Lipton ice tea, Tango and Pepsi itself – so what the US group wants is not irrelevant in a takeover situation. Unfortunately, PepsiCo’s thinking is that fewer and bigger global bottlers are better. As Monday’s document put it, it wants to “drive consolidation of its bottling partners across contiguous markets”. Since Carlsberg already bottles for PepsiCo in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, it fits the bill as a pan-European bottler in the making. Indeed, Carlsberg secured PepsiCo’s blessing to move for Britvic at the outset of this saga and not simply mid-scrap as previously thought; change of control clauses will be waived. That feels tough on Britvic, whose UK relationship with PepsiCo goes back to 1987 and was extended in 2020 to 2040. Its reward for success is to be treated as a pawn in the eternal global battle between Coca-Cola (for whom Carlsberg bottles in Denmark and Finland) and PepsiCo. That’s life, sadly. From Carlsberg’s point of view, the deal does indeed make compelling sense. It is separately buying the pub chain Marston’s 40% stake in Carlsberg Marston’s, currently a UK joint venture, to get full control of the operation for £206m. So it will emerge with chunkier UK business, covering beer and soft drinks, from which it expects to squeeze £100m of annual savings eventually from combined distribution costs and so on. Even though Carlsberg will still be a distant fourth in UK brewing, its chief executive, Jacob Aarup-Andersen, can speak credibly about building a “UK powerhouse”: the UK is now the Danes’ biggest market, overtaking China, and the makeup of revenues is a model of his “beyond beer” strategy. Carlsberg looks the winner in this transaction. Britvic shareholders get only a so-so premium, reflecting a weak negotiating hand. It is not a moment to crack open the Fruit Shoots.\n",

The effective ban on onshore windfarms was today dropped by the Labour government, in news that has delighted environmental and energy experts. The ban was caused by two footnotes to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), the rules which govern the building of homes and infrastructure. These footnotes applied only to onshore wind, no other type of infrastructure, and required such strong proof that there was no opposition locally that they made building turbines impossible, given there is nearly always some local resistance to any building proposal. In Labour’s proposed new NPPF, these footnotes have been deleted in their entirety, meaning that onshore wind projects are now on an even footing with all other forms of infrastructure.

In March Fitch upgraded the outlook on the UK’s AA- rating from “negative” to “stable” after the chaos of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini-budget”. The election result will mean more “near-term political stability”, Fitch said on Monday. Views on the sustainability or otherwise of sovereign debts are somewhat subjective, but Fitch – along with rivals S&P Global and Moody’s – still retain power as some investors take into account ratings when deciding on investments. Fitch said that Labour could struggle to stick to the path of “fiscal consolidation” – reducing debt.  We still view implementing this projected consolidation as politically challenging, notwithstanding the margin of Labour’s election victory, as it would involve real cuts in unprotected spending and investment that would likely further strain public services.      1.38pm BST   Metro Bank is reportedly trying to sell a chunk of mortgages as it tries to turn its fortunes around after a rescue deal. The high street lender is working with investment bank Morgan Stanley on a process to raise capital from the sale of the mortgages, and could make between £3bn and £4bn, Sky News reported, citing sources. Metro was co-founded by the US billionaire Vernon Hill and became the UK’s first new high street lender in 150 years when it launched in 2010. It reached a £925m rescue package in October led by the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal, who took a 53% stake in Metro as a result of the deal. Since then it has cut 1,000 workers and stopped opening seven days a week as it tries to clamp down on costs.     1.03pm BST   Haskel says that inflation can become sticky at higher rates if the labour market is “impaired” – meaning it is harder to match unemployed people to vacancies. He worries that the economy is still impaired, meaning the Bank of England will have to respond with relatively tighter monetary policy in order to get inflation sustainably down to its 2% target. UK inflation hit 2% in May for the first time since July 2021.  The labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably.      12.55pm BST   Jonathan Haskel has come out strongly against the “greedflation” narrative, that businesses were pushing up inflation by increasing profits. That runs counter to analysis by some economists, including at the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and thinktanks such as the IPPR and the Common Wealth. Haskel said:  While there may be variation across firms, products and industries, there is no evidence for this in aggregate in the UK, at least that I can discern in official data. The level of corporate profits has increased, but so too has the level of wages and the level of prices. As a share of total national income, profits have remained largely the same.      12.42pm BST   Jonathan Haskel has served on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee for six years. As he comes to the end of his second and final term, he appears to be less concerned about showing his hand. He argues in his speech that the Bank was right to raise interest rates in 2021 to stop inflationary pressures from building up further during the global supply chain chaos caused by coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. He said:  High inflation, no matter what the cause, risks becoming embedded if it persists for too long.  And he thinks that some of those pressures remain in the UK, even as some of the massive price increases caused by the energy crisis after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have faded.  Underlying inflation is persistent and declining more slowly, with headline inflation pushed around by volatile energy and base effects.   Updated at 12.42pm BST    12.15pm BST  Bank of England rate-setter: 'I would rather hold rates'  The Bank of England should hold interest rates steady rather than cutting to ensure inflationary pressures have subsided, according to a member of the monetary policy committee (MPC). Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College and an external member of the rate-setting MPC, said that despite “encouraging signs” on falling inflation, “I would rather hold rates”. In a speech at King’s College London, he said:  There are considerable encouraging signs, most notably from normalising inflation expectations and a (spoiler: temporary) return of headline inflation to target in May 2024. However, the wage-price system in the UK has been subject to a sequence of enormous shocks over recent years. The playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time. I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably.      11.50am BST   Shares in London-listed insurer Hiscox have jumped 14% after reports that two rivals were considering takeover bids. Japan’s Sompo and Italy’s Generali are interested in a possible buyout, according to industry publication Insurance Insider. Hiscox was valued at £3.8bn at the end of last week – meaning Monday’s share price move has added half a billion pounds to its market value. If it retains that valuation – or indeed if a takeover bid comes through – then it could be enough to push the company back into the FTSE 100 index. Hiscox is one of the biggest members of the FTSE 250 index, having previously entered the FTSE 100.     11.36am BST  Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud charge  Boeing will plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge stemming from two deadly crashes of 737 Max jetliners, after the government determined the company violated an agreement that had protected it from prosecution for more than three years, the US the government said in court filing late on Sunday. Federal prosecutors gave Boeing the choice this week of entering a guilty plea and paying a fine as part of its sentence, or facing a trial on the felony criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the US. The plea deal, which still must receive the approval of a federal judge to take effect, calls for Boeing to pay an additional $243.6m fine, according to a justice department (DOJ) document filed in federal court in Texas. Boeing has also agreed to invest at least $455m over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programs, the DOJ said. The department will appoint a third-party monitor to oversee the firm’s compliance. The monitor will have to publicly file with the court annual reports on the company’s progress. A guilty plea potentially threatens the company’s ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the US defence department and Nasa, although it could seek waivers. Boeing became exposed to criminal prosecution after the justice department in May found the company violated a 2021 settlement involving the fatal crashes. You can read the full story here:   Related: Boeing will plead guilty to criminal fraud over 737 Max crashes, justice department says       11.10am BST   Rachel Reeves has said that the government has no intention of changing the way that the Bank of England treats reserve remuneration. That idea has been floated by various economists and commentators – and even made its way into the Reform UK manifesto. It would mean the Bank of England paying a lower rate of interest to commercial banks. However, Reeves has now ruled it out pretty firmly. You can follow more from Reeves’s speech on our politics live blog here:   Related: ‘There is no money’, says Rachel Reeves in first major speech as chancellor – UK politics live       11.05am BST  Rachel Reeves has said the government will introduce mandatory housing targets  Rachel Reeves has pledged to “get Britain building again” after saying the government will introduce mandatory housing targets in her first major speech as UK chancellor. Local authorities will retain the power to decide on planning applications “in the first instance”, but can be overruled nationally if they fail to meet their targets. “The answer cannot always be ‘no’,” said Reeves, who is the first woman to be chancellor in the UK.  Reeves said it was not a “green light” for any type of home, but that Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister as well as housing secretary, will push for more building. Rayner has already called in decisions blocking two data centres. Reeves said:  The deputy prime minister will take an interventionist approach to make sure we’ve got the housing that we need.  Housebuilders will also be an important part of the government’s plans. Reeves said: “We need the private sector to build homes.” Reeves claimed the new Labour government has done “more in 72 hours than last government did in 14 years” to fix the planning system.  There is no time to waste. We will end the prevarication, and make the necessary choices to fix the foundations.  Reeves also said that the government will look at encouraging pension funds to invest in UK companies.     10.31am BST   The French elections have given investors pause across Europe, according to a newly published poll. The Sentix investor poll slipped to -7.3 points, its lowest point since March. That ended a run of eight consecutive improvements in investors’ perceptions of the eurozone economy. Patrick Hussy, Sentix’s managing director, said:  The recent recovery of the European economy has come to an abrupt end. The moderate economic momentum in Germany is also faltering again. The positive mood due to the European Football Championship 2024 is not spilling over into the economy. The already gloomy assessment of the situation deteriorated to -32.3 points, while expectations fell to -4.8 points below the April value. The French elections are contributing to the growing concern, as is the increasing slowdown in the US economy.       10.10am BST  Paramount and Skydance to merge in $28bn deal  The family behind Paramount, one of Hollywood’s most iconic companies, has agreed to sell the business to the independent company Skydance. Paramount chair Shari Redstone, whose father, Sumner, bought the company in 1994, has now given the greenlight to the sale of the family’s controlling stake in company which produced classic films such as The Godfather, Titanic and Chinatown. Paramount also owns the television network CBS and channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon. The deal, which values the company at $28bn (£22bn), brings an end to more than six months of negotiations. It will see Skydance and Paramount merge, with Skydance agreeing to invest $8bn into the new company. Skydance will then pay a further $2.4bn to buy National Amusements, the Redstone-owned theatre movie operator which holds nearly 80% of voting shares in Paramount. The agreement comes just four years after the death of Sumner Redstone, whose company Viacom bought Paramount Pictures three decades ago in a deal worth $10bn. Shari took over after his passing but has seen it struggle in recent years with the value of its shares falling by more than 75% in the last five years.     10.05am BST   What are the prospects for a government in France? Don’t hold your breath for big changes to spending plans any time soon. That is the verdict of Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. French bonds and the euro initially sold off after the result came, but they are now flat. That is “the right call”, said Vistesen, given the small probability of movement for a while as complex negotiations start. Vistesen wrote:  Grand coalitions, like for example in Germany, are not the norm in France, but that could be the only solution this time around, given the fragmented parliament. The conditions for a minority government to rule, meanwhile, is that it does not face a blocking majority. As an initial base case, we have to assume that the left will attempt to capitalise on its victory to pull any government as far left as possible on economic policy. This, in turn, would increase the risk of a standoff with the EU over fiscal policy. This is why the Euro and French bonds initially sold off in response to the result. They’re now both virtually unchanged on the day, however, which is the right call. A lot of negotiation lies ahead before we see the new government, let alone what it can and can’t do.       9.23am BST   The French election has meant that Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) will not be in power, but it has not settled what France’s new government will look like. The New Popular Front (NFP), the hastily arranged coalition of left-wing parties, won the most seats, but it is far short of a parliamentary majority. The result will mean a lot of negotiation to agree on who will be the new prime minister – let alone on achieving anything meaningful in governing the country. It means there are some complicated scenarios to weigh up, although for financial markets it also means the likelihood of a major political shift – and with it major spending decisions is put off. That may explain the muted market reaction. Philippe Ledent, a senior economist at ING, an investment bank, said the result “plunges France further into the unknown”.  The French parliament is more divided than ever, made up mainly of three blocs (Left – 182 seats, Centre – 168 seats, Extreme Right – 143 seats) and a number of smaller ones. As we predicted before the elections, no bloc can claim an absolute majority.  Ledent sketches out two options:  Minority governmentFrench political parties “are not used to making concessions in order to create a programme around a coalition with other parties”, and the NFP’s most prominent figure, Jean-Luc Mélenchon demanded its entire programme be implemented. “If political parties maintain such positions, a long period of instability will ensue,” said Ledent.“Without an absolute majority, and given the radical nature of its socioeconomic programme, the left-wing bloc won’t be able to pass a single law, unless it uses the tool (article 49.3 to force legislation) that it decried so much itself during the previous legislature. A motion of censure would probably be tabled very quickly, bringing down the government.” It is a similar situation if Macron tries to install a prime minister from his own bloc, or even from the right.Instability would last until at least June 2025, since the president cannot call for new elections before then. Learning to cooperate“Excluding the 80 MPs from the far left and the 145 from the far right, there are over 350 MPs left to form a broad coalition ready to reform France, taking into account the diversity of opinions. In other European countries, including Germany, such a configuration would be quite natural and would result in a government with a clear majority.“Certainly, some doors are beginning to open for such a coalition. Of course, the President’s camp is in favour.”“The French political parties are stuck in a strategic game where the only solution is for the parties to work together. It would help restore calm and political stability. But, not knowing what attitude the other parties will adopt and because any concession on its programme would be seen as a betrayal of its electorate, no party seems willing to enter into discussions in the very short term.”      9.01am BST  France's Cac 40 index swings into positive territory for the day  After an initial drop, France’s benchmark Cac 40 index has also swivelled into positive territory.  Shares in Paris are up by 0.36%. Investors often favour political stalemates, as they can reduce the scope for policies that will markedly change a country’s fiscal position.      8.56am BST   The FTSE 100 has now edged into the black for today: it is up by 0.02%. B&M European Value Retail, the owner of B&M Bargains, is the biggest riser, up 2.1%.     8.33am BST  Marston's abandons brewing after 149 years in £206m Carlsberg deal  Shares in pub company Marston’s have surged by 20% after it agreed for Carlsberg to buy out its part of a brewing joint venture for £206m. The deal means that Marston’s will abandon its roots as a brewer – previously known as Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries – stretching back to 1875. Carlsberg will take complete control of ales including Hobgoblin, Brakspear, Pedigree and Wainwright. Marston’s first gave up 60% of the brewing business to Carlsberg in 2020, part of a broader consolidation in the brewing industry that saw the biggest brewers take over smaller companies.   Related: Brewers Carlsberg UK and Marston's announce merger   The latest deal, a buyout of the remaining 40% of the joint venture, means Marston’s will be left running its estate of about 1,370 pubs. The pubs are mainly located in suburbs around the UK. Marston’s said the deal would cut its annual interest bill by £18m. Justin Platt, Marston’s chief executive, said:  Our core capability and key opportunity to unlock value for shareholders is in driving a focused and successful pub business. This deal further strengthens our balance sheet, significantly reducing our debt by over £200m. In addition, CMBC remain valued strategic partners and we continue to benefit from our ongoing long-term brand distribution agreement with them. Crucially, it allows us to become a pure play hospitality business and focus on what we do best – namely, giving our guests amazing pub experiences.      8.18am BST   The FTSE 100 in London has also dipped in the opening trades. It was down by 0.3%. That appeared to have been driven partly by a drop in gold and silver prices, which weighed on mining company stocks. The top five fallers were the mining contingent: Anglo American, Endeavour Mining, Rio Tinto, Antofagasta and Glencore. They were all down by between 0.9% and 1.5%. Elsewhere Germany’s Dax index was down 0.1%, Spain’s Ibex was down 0.2%, and the Euro Stoxx index dropped 0.2%.     8.08am BST  Cac 40 stock index drops after France election surprise; Britvic to be bought by Carlsberg  Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. France’s left-wing coalition came first in the second round of its parliamentary election in a shock result that keeps the far-right out of power. Investors are bracing for uncertainty as they wait to see whether the left can work with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together alliance.   Related: France election: surprise win for leftwing alliance keeps Le Pen’s far right from power   France’s benchmark stock index, the Cac 40, dropped by 0.5% in the opening trades on Monday morning. The euro dipped as currency markets opened on Sunday evening, dropping as low as $1.08 against the US dollar. However, it recovered most of its losses on Monday morning as investors weighted up the prospect of a period of political gridlock as the left-wing New Popular Front tries to work with Together. France’s Cac 40 stock market index was due to drop by 0.6% when stock markets open on Monday morning. Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said the election would spell the end for Macron’s investor-friendly reforms. He said:  The political forces that joined forces to prevent an RN government have little else in common. Their views on migration, social and cultural issues, fiscal policy and the need for pro-growth reforms are often diametrically opposed. Forming a government will not be easy. Times are tough, emotions are running high – and France has no tradition of forging coalitions between parties of very different political persuasions.  Britvic agrees to sweetened Carlsberg offer On UK stock markets, FTSE 250 drinks maker Britvic has agreed to a takeover by Danish brewer Carlsberg after a sweetened deal valued the Fruit Shoot maker at £3.3bn. Britvic shareholders will be entitled to receive £13.15 per share, versus a close of £12.10 on Friday and 36% above the £9.70 price on 19 June, when news of the takeover got out. The company, which also makes the J2O juice drink and Robinson’s squash, had initially rejected a £3.1bn offer on 21 June. Britvic’s directors will unanimously vote in favour of the acquisition, the company said on Monday morning in a statement to the stock market. It will be only the latest in a series of foreign takeovers of prominent British companies. Carlsberg’s executives and bankers have been busy: they have also bought out the share of UK company Marston’s in a brewery joint venture. More details of that deal to come.  \n",
      "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, angering the families of the hundreds of passengers killed who had wanted the case to go to trial. Federal prosecutors had found that the American aircraft manufacturer was in violation of a 2021 agreement struck after the crashes, which had protected it from prosecution for more than three years. Last week they gave Boeing the choice of entering a guilty plea and paying a fine as part of its sentence or facing a trial on the felony criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the US over the crashes, which claimed 346 lives. Under the new plea deal, which must receive the approval of a federal judge to take effect, Boeing will pay a $243.6m (£190m) fine, according to a justice department (DoJ) document filed in federal court in Texas. The company has also agreed to invest at least $455m over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programmes, the department said. In October 2018, 189 people were killed when Lion Air flight 610 fell into the Java Sea off Indonesia. In March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa airport, claiming 157 lives. In 2021, federal prosecutors alleged that Boeing committed conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about a flight-control system that was implicated in the crashes. However, they agreed not to prosecute if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting. However, in January a panel blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing it to land. Although nobody was hurt, scrutiny on Boeing’s safety record ramped up again and in May the Department of Justice found it had violated the 2021 deal, reopening the prospect of prosecution. Relatives of the Max crash victims were briefed on the agreement a week ago and labelled it a “sweetheart plea deal” that spared Boeing the scrutiny of a criminal trial. They objected in a filing, saying the deal “unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive, and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths … the generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises”. Paul Cassell, who represents 15 victims’ families, said the deal was “clearly not in the public interest” and appealed to the judge to “reject this inappropriate plea and simply set the matter for a public trial”. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for 16 families of crash victims, said: “This was a sweetheart deal, and so Boeing accepting it is par for the course. Now the fight – and there will be one – under relevant statutes and rules of criminal procedure.” The families also expressed frustration about the size of the financial penalty. “Without a hefty fine, there will be zero safety impact at Boeing,” Erin Applebaum, another attorney acting for relatives, said last week. “The fine should have been in the billions, not the millions.” The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the objection. In its filing to the court regarding the proposed plea deal, it claimed that it had given the families “numerous opportunities” to express their views and they had “meaningfully and substantially” taken part in several conferral meetings. Families were particularly angered when informed late last month that Boeing would be able to appoint its own corporate monitor to oversee the company. The plea agreement addresses this specific concern, stating that the government will appoint the monitor. A guilty plea potentially threatens Boeing’s ability to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the US defence department and Nasa, although it could seek waivers. However, it also makes it easier for the company, which will have a new CEO later this year, to move forward as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. The deal does not give Boeing immunity for other incidents, including January’s cabin panel blowout. “While many of us would have preferred a more vigorous prosecution, a guilty plea to a felony is a serious step up in accountability from the initial deferred prosecution agreement,” said Mark Lindquist, an attorney representing a family of an Ethiopian crash victim and 31 passengers from the Alaskan Airlines flight. The deal also does not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation. A Boeing spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the justice department, subject to the memorialisation and approval of specific terms.”\n",
      "Trade unions, celebrities and river activists are calling on the new UK government to halt attempts by the water industry to raise customer bills in England and Wales by up to 91% and immediately start a root-and-branch review of water ownership. The author Michael Rosen and comedians Nish Kumar and Stephen Fry joined campaigners from Greenpeace, Surfers Against Sewage, River Action, the Rivers Trust and activists across the country in signing a letter to Keir Starmer urging him to step in, days before the regulator Ofwat is to announce whether it will approve huge increases in customer bills across England and Wales. Some of the most polluting and financially struggling water companies, including Thames Water and Southern Water, are seeking the biggest increases in bills. Thames Water wants customer bills to rise by 59% after accounting for inflation. Southern is seeking to raise bills by 91% by 2030, to £915 a year. The letter, organised by the campaign group We Own It, was also signed by the GMB and Unite unions. It says: “Saturday marked 35 years since the Water Act 1989 established our current model of water and sewage management, including privatisation and top-down regulation. “Bills have risen at twice the rate of inflation. No new drinking reservoirs have been delivered. A quarter of our supply leaks out of our pipes. Debts are unpaid; plans ‘uninvestable’. And last year, operators released sewage for over 3m hours into our rivers and seas. “If the current failed model remains in place, Labour could be fighting the next election with some bills topping £915 a year and sewage a greater threat to our health than ever.” The letter calls on the prime minister to pause the current price-setting process and start a root-and-branch public review of ownership and regulation immediately, including consultation with water campaigners, trade union representatives and customers. Water companies are promising their biggest ever investment of £100bn to fix ageing infrastructure, cut sewage discharges and build new reservoirs, 35 years after the sector was privatised. They are acting after a public outcry over sewage pollution in rivers and seas, and a decline in the state of English rivers to a situation in which no river is deemed to be in good health. As well as concern over river health, there are growing fears about the threat to public health from the way wastewater is treated in England. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, has said public health must be central to future investment in a new wastewater system to protect people from waterborne diseases from contact with rivers and coastal waters polluted by treated and untreated sewage. The regulator Ofwat, which is itself under pressure for allowing companies to pay dividends of £78bn in the past three decades while building debts of £60bn, will on Thursday announce whether it approves the business plans of the main water and sewerage companies. The Ofwat decision, which was delayed until 11 July because of the general election, comes amid a growing crisis in the water sector. Thames Water, the biggest privatised water monopoly, is struggling to stay afloat with debts of almost £15bn, and investors are threatening to pull the plug on the company. Ofwat has flagged concerns over the financial resilience of other privatised companies, including Southern Water, SES Water and South East Water, as of the highest concern. The financial resilience of Yorkshire Water and Portsmouth Water is also of concern by the regulator. ​ “No other country in the world runs water and sewage in the way we do: 90% is publicly owned and delivered,” the letter to Starmer says. “Regulation has been flawed, captured, and underfunded: a constant threat of the current model. Accountability must be reviewed, including putting community representatives on company boards and using ‘sunshine regulation’ to deliver greater transparency.”\n",
      "The UK soft drinks maker Britvic has agreed to an improved £3.3bn takeover offer from the Danish brewer Carlsberg. Britvic, whose brands include J20, Robinsons and R White’s lemonade, accepted the £13.15 a share offer after rejecting previous takeover offers from Carlsberg on the grounds that they undervalued the company. In a statement to the stock exchange on Monday, Carlsberg said Britvic’s board would unanimously recommend the deal, which comprises £12.90 in cash for each Britvic share and a special dividend payment of 25p for each share. The deal would create a new enlarged group named Carlsberg Britvic.   Related: French stock market swings to gain after election surprise; Britvic agrees to improved Carlsberg offer – business live   Britvic shares rose 4.5% on Monday to £12.65, making it one of the top risers on the FTSE 250. The deal will need the backing of 75% of Britvic investors in a shareholder vote. Britvic was founded in the UK in the 1930s as the British Vitamin Products Company and used soft drinks as an affordable way of supplying vitamins to consumers. It has 39 brands in 100 countries including Brazil, France and Ireland. It also has an exclusive licence with PepsiCo in Great Britain and Ireland to make and sell Pepsi Max, 7UP, Rockstar Energy and Lipton Ice Tea. As part of the deal, Carlsberg has secured agreement from Pepsico to waive a clause in its bottling contract with Britvic that would have allowed it to cancel the arrangement on the event of a change of ownership. Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said: “With this transaction, we are combining Britvic’s high-quality soft drinks portfolio with Carlsberg’s strong beer portfolio and route-to-market capabilities, creating an enhanced proposition across the UK and markets in western Europe.” Carlsberg has said the acquisition would create annual cost savings of about £100m over five years, including through procurement and supply chain efficiencies as well as economies in administration and overheads. Ian Durant, the Britvic non-executive chair, said: “The proposed transaction creates an enlarged international group that is well-placed to capture the growth opportunities in multiple drinks sectors. “Crucially, to remain competitive at a time when the market is being shaped by the trend of increasing consolidation among bottling partners, Carlsberg’s agreement with PepsiCo provides the combined group with a strong platform for continued success.” Carlsberg also announced on Monday that it had separately agreed a deal to acquire Marston’s minority stake in Carlsberg Marston’s, the company’s brewing business in the UK, which is now the fourth biggest beer company in the country. It said that Marston’s would remain an important partner for the new enlarged business and its long-term drinks supply and distribution agreement would remain in place. The deal means that Marston’s will abandon its roots as a brewer – previously known as Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries – stretching back to 1875. Carlsberg will take complete control of ales including Hobgoblin, Brakspear, Pedigree and Wainwright.\n"
